                <p> The transcribers and editor attempted to render the author’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when the author’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Additionally, many questions remain about
                    spelling the names of his Quaker acquaintances, individual Native Americans who
                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor
                    attempted to remain faithful to the author’s Anglicized spellings in all cases.

                    make every thing agree-<lb/>able &amp; satisfactory, I wish you to consider of
                    it<lb/> calmly &amp; deliberately and give me an answer <lb/>tomorrow.- If the
                    Warriors wish to live in peace<lb/> with the U.- States, if they wish to make
                    the Chain<lb/> of friendship bright they will sign the Articles of the

                            answer you<lb/> in a few words; We are thankful to the great Spirit that
                            he has preserved us in<lb/> health to see each others faces at this
                            Council fire; we &amp; our Brethren at home have<lb/> the same good will
                            towards you as our forefathers had, &amp; are desirous to afford you
                            any<lb/> service in our power, &amp; that you may cherish peace with one
                            another &amp; with all<lb/> Men, believing this will greatly contribute
                            to your happiness; we sympathize<lb/> with you in your sufferings &amp;
                            distress, &amp; wish strict justice to be done you respect<lb/>ing your
                            Lands, you have been informed we can take no part in war, which is
                            one<lb/> great reason why we cannot be active in civil Government &amp;
                            therefore are not capable<lb/> of judging of all your grievances,
                            especially as the transactions at Indian Treaties of<lb/> late years
                            have not fully come to our knowledge; you have spoken to us respecting

                            appears to be a matter of importance to you, it would be proper to lay

                                >Pennsylvania</placeName>, &amp; we do not suppose the Commissioner
                            has power to<lb/> relinquish it; It is true the President &amp; his
                            Counsellors have impowered a Commis<lb/>sioner to treat with you, but we
                            think the Government has no design to compel<lb/> you, you have Men
                            amongst you of good Understanding &amp; sufficient penetration<lb/> to
                            discover what your just rights are, &amp; if your minds are not easy
                            with the proposals that<lb/> have been made, we make no doubt but the
                            Ear of the President &amp; the great Council<lb/> of the United States
                            will be open to hear you, &amp; to them we conceive you have a
                            right<lb/> to appeal; we desire Wisdom may conduct your Councils that
                            whatever is done may<lb/> tend to promote harmony &amp; peace. We then
                            returned the Strings of Wampum.</p>
