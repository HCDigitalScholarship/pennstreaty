                    on my journey <lb/>into the Indian Country and Upper Canada. Dined at

                    <date when="1799-08-27">27<emph rend="italics">th.</emph></date> Rode over and
                    through the gap in several <lb/>mountains, past a furnace known by the name of
                    <lb/>Kittera's. The precipices on both right and left of <lb/>one of them
                    exhibited a magnificent appearance. <lb/>After which we entered a limestone
                    valley of good <lb/>land, though not improved, as I apprehended, in the
                    <lb/>best manner. Fed our horses at the stone tavern, <lb/>sixteen miles; [then]
                    to <placeName ref="shipp">Shippensburg</placeName> twelve and <lb/>one-half
                    miles, part of which, notwithstanding it was <lb/>in the valley, appeared to be
                    very poor, covered with <lb/>pine of small growth and barren oaks. A few miles
                    <lb/>before we reached <placeName ref="shipp">Shippensburg</placeName> we passed
                    through <lb/>some excellent wheat land, being covered with black <lb/>oak and
                    hickory. Dined at <placeName ref="shipp">Shippensburg</placeName>. The
                    gen-<lb/>eral part of the corn thus far very poor; buckwheat, <lb/>in some
                    place, pretty good. Then proceeded to a <lb/>small village called <placeName
                        key="stras">Strasburg</placeName>, ten miles; through <lb/>tolerable land
                    but no water which I thought fit to <lb/>drink for myself or horse for twenty
                    miles. Then <lb/>ascended the mountain called the Blue Ridge, the <lb/>ascent
                    and descent of which is three miles, affording <lb/>a prospect which shows the
                    wonderful works of the <lb/>Author of Nature. Crossed a branch of the <geogName
                        key="conod">Conodo-<lb/>guinet</geogName> running to the right, and lodged
                    at <persName ref="jskin1">Skinner's</persName>
                    <lb/>in Horse Valley. This day's ride, forty-one and a<lb/> half miles.</p>
                <p>
                    <date when="1799-08-28">28<emph rend="italics">th.</emph></date> In the morning,
                    ascended and descended <lb/>two large mountains, the valley between them called
                        <lb/><geogName ref="pathv">Path Valley</geogName>, in which is a small
                    village called <placeName ref="ferri">Ferris-<lb/>burg</placeName>; it being
                    seven miles across those two moun-<lb/>tains. In the aforesaid valley is a fine
                    stream run-<lb/>ning to the right, called <geogName ref="conoc">Conogocheak
                        [Conoco-<lb/>cheague]</geogName>; and a pretty good settlement. After
                    <lb/>crossing the mountains, very poor broken land thinly <lb/>inhabited, to
                        <placeName ref="flitt">Fort Littleton</placeName>, twelve miles from
                        <lb/><persName ref="jskin1">Skinner's</persName>; here we breakfasted. In
                    crossing those <lb/>mountains and valleys my mind was much em-<lb/>ployed in
                    contemplating the wonderful works of an <lb/>all-wise Creator.</p>
                <p> To <persName ref="jskin1">John Skinner's</persName> on the top of <geogName
                        key="sidel">Sidling Hill</geogName>, <lb/>eleven miles, being a tremendous
                    mountain, on the <lb/>ridge of which we rode about four miles; at the end
                    <lb/>thereof, and descending the mountain, a grand pros-<lb/>pect opened of the
                        <geogName ref="allmo">Allegheny Mountain</geogName> and what<lb/> appeared a
                    tolerably level valley, considerably im-<lb/>proved with plantations; but in
                    riding through it we <lb/>found it to be very hilly, approached to mountains;
                    <lb/>then crossed a branch of <geogName ref="junia">Juniata</geogName>, running
                    to the <lb/>right, and rode to <persName ref="hart1">Hartley's</persName>, where
                    we expect to lodge. <lb/>The river was frequently on our right hand and
                    fre-<lb/>quently near our left hand, and we on an eminence <lb/>perhaps of one
                    or two hundred feet, some place ap-<lb/>proaching near perpendicular. This day's
                    ride, thir-<lb/>ty-nine miles.</p>
                <p>
                    <date when="1799-08-29">29<emph rend="italics">th.</emph></date> Rode up the
                    valley through some tolerably <lb/>good limestone land to <placeName ref="bedfo"
                        >Bedford</placeName>, six miles; crossed two <lb/>branches of the aforesaid
                    water. After leaving <placeName ref="bedfo">Bed-<lb/>ford</placeName> passed
                    through a gap in <geogName ref="wilmo">Wills' Mountain</geogName> and <lb/>over
                        <geogName ref="junia">Juniata</geogName> again. Here is some of the best
                    land <lb/>and the best improved I have yet seen amongst those <lb/>mountains. To
                    our right to Stotler on the ridge, in <lb/>divers places was oats growing of a
                    good length; some <lb/>ripe, some almost ripe, and some standing in shock.
                    <lb/>From thence to <placeName ref="berli">Berlin</placeName>, thirteen miles.
                    On our way <lb/>we met an old man who had just killed a large buck <lb/>which
                    had horns with a number of prongs, covered <lb/>with the velvet, which he had
                    skinned and had some <lb/>
                    <pb n="453" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_02"/> of the meat tied up in it carrying about
                    his neck in <lb/>the manner of a knapsack. In riding six miles we <lb/>came to
                    the foot of the great <geogName ref="allmo">Allegheny mountains</geogName>
                    <lb/>where is some good land; buckwheat and oats about <lb/>of an equal
                    ripeness, both good, but the buckwheat <lb/>extraordinary; as much so as I think
                    I have ever <lb/>seen. The ascent of this mountain better land than <lb/>any of
                    the others, being covered with lofty timber of <lb/>divers sorts, and on the top
                    of said mountain got some <lb/>excellent water, being the first I have met with
                    since <lb/>I left home. After we got over the mountains the <lb/>timber was very
                    thick but much destroyed with fire. <lb/>Two or three miles before we came to
                        <placeName ref="berli">Berlin</placeName> the land <lb/>appeared to be
                    excellent, covered with heavy timber, <lb/>black oak, white oak, red oak,
                    hickory, and sugar <lb/>maple, grass and other vegetables very flourishing, it
                    <lb/>having been a wet growing season. This day's ride, <lb/>thirty-six
                    miles.</p>

                    <date when="1799-08-30">30<emph rend="italics">th.</emph></date> Took an early
                    set-off from <placeName ref="berli">Berlin</placeName>, being a <lb/>village of
                    about 50 houses; passed through some very <lb/>rough lands and roads on which I
                    saw a rattlesnake <lb/>about three feet long with ten rattles, lying in the
                    <lb/>road, appearing to have been just killed by a wagon-<lb/>wheel running over
                    it. Part of the way to this stage <lb/>the land was covered with most beautiful
                    lofty chest-<lb/>nuts, and part of the way very thick set with white <lb/>pine,
                    being thirteen miles; [reached] a Dutch tavern <lb/>where we thought best to
                    breakfast on our own choco-<lb/>late. From thence to <persName ref="gbach1"
                        >George Bachelor's</persName>, fourteen <lb/>miles in which we crossed what
                    is called <geogName ref="laure">Laurel Hill</geogName>, <lb/>being one mountain
                    after another for seven or eight <lb/>miles of the way. The ascent of one of
                    them ex-<lb/>ceeded all for chestnut timber I ever saw; they stand <lb/>so thick
                    together and are so tall that I fully believe <lb/>there are thousands of acres
                    that would yield more <lb/>than 10,000 rails to the acre. Almost all those
                    moun-<lb/>tains that go by the aforesaid name are the most fer-<lb/>tile of any
                    I have yet seen; the trees and vegetables <lb/>of every kind are so luxuriant I
                    could not help feel-<lb/>ing some attachment to the place; but when I
                    con-<lb/>sidered the exceeding rough mountainous face of the <lb/>surface and
                    the intolerable road to and from the <lb/>place, I am content if I should live
                    to return to spend <lb/>the remainder of my days in <placeName ref="chest1"
                        >Chester County</placeName>. Pro-<lb/>ceeded to <placeName ref="conne1"
                        >Connelstown</placeName>, being a new settled place of <lb/>about fifty
                    houses on the <geogName ref="yough">Yoghagena [Youghiogheny]
                        <lb/>river</geogName>. Lodged with our old friends, <persName ref="tgibs1"
                        >Thomas</persName> and <lb/><persName ref="jgibs1">Joshua Gibson</persName>,
                    sixteen miles. Nothing very remark-<lb/>able the last stage, except in one place
                    about six miles <lb/>back, we rose to or on an eminence where a grand
                    <lb/>prospect opened to view, to the east, the north, and <lb/>the west,
                    particularly to the west where we could see <lb/>as far as the eye could reach-I
                    suppose as far as the <lb/><geogName ref="ohior">Ohio river</geogName>. Here on
                    the <geogName ref="yough">Yoghagena river</geogName> the people <lb/>were
                    employed in building flat-bottomed boats, the <lb/>stern of which they cover
                    with thin boards for a <lb/>shelter. Some of them are thirty, some forty, and
                    <lb/>some fifty feet long and twelve wide, in which they <lb/>will carry 360
                    barrels of flour or iron or other pro-<lb/>duce in proportion, to Kentucky or

                    <date when="1799-08-31">31<emph rend="italics">st.</emph></date> Crossed the
                        <geogName ref="yough">Yoghogany</geogName>, being a small river,
                    <lb/>perhaps hal fas large as <geogName ref="schri">Schuylkill</geogName> above
                    the Falls. <lb/>About a mile from said river as we rode up a small <lb/>stream
                    large enough to turn a mill, we came to a curi-<lb/>ous limestone rock lying
                    horizontal, about three feet <lb/>thick, forming a concave semi-circle of
                    perhaps 300 <lb/>feet, near the centre of which the water fell about <lb/>
                    twenty-eight feet there being a walk on another rock <lb/>about twelve feet
                    below the other, and near the same <lb/>distance deep back behind the water
                    where we might <lb/>safely walk. Just at one side and near the centre of<lb/>the
                    semi-circle a spacious grist mill is built butting up <lb/>against the rock.
                    Then passed over many hills and <lb/>valleys to <persName ref="rcadw1">Reese
                        Cadwallader,s</persName>, twenty miles. Passed <lb/>a new paper-mill
                    occupied by <persName ref="jshar3">Jonathan Sharpless</persName>, on
                        <lb/><geogName ref="redst">Redstone creek</geogName>; also <persName
                        key="sjack1">Samuel Jackson's</persName> grist mill at <lb/>the mouth of
                    said creek, over which there is a large <lb/>bridge, near thirty feet high, wide
                    enough for a wagon <lb/>to cross. We were expecting to find a road in
                    pro-<lb/>portion; but immediately after getting over we found <lb/>ourselves on
                    a narrow path perhaps not more than <lb/>five feet wide, and a precipice on our
                    left hand down to <lb/>
                    <geogName ref="redst">Redstone creek</geogName>, and on our right hand down to
                    <lb/>the <geogName ref="monon">Monongahela river</geogName>, each of them near
                    perpen-<lb/>dicular, which was near 200 feet, which to some of <lb/>our company
                    was truly alarming; and I believe <lb/>would have been more so had it not been
                    that a <lb/>bulky woman rode on just before us seemingly with-<lb/>out care or
                    fear. Then rode up the last mentioned <lb/>river through a beautiful town on the
                    bank of the <lb/>same, perhaps of forty or fifty houses. This river I <lb/>think
                    is larger than <geogName ref="schri">Schuylkill</geogName>, running to the
                    right. <lb/>The land thus far through the Redstone settlement is <lb/>very rough
                    and mountainous, and appears to be very <lb/>fertile, producing wheat, rye,
                    oats, buckwheat, and <lb/>grass in abundance even on the top of the hills, and
                    <lb/>abundance of lofty timber of many sorts, particularly <lb/>sugar maple and
                    white oak. But notwithstanding it <lb/>hath been a very wet growing season and
                    all kinds of <lb/>grain in the ground and vegetables look luxuriant, <lb/>yet
                    the waters are very low, which induces me to <lb/>believe that, when the land
                    comes to be more gener-<lb/>ally cleared and a dry season takes place (which I
                    <lb/>suppose frequently does), the inhabitants will suffer <lb/>from lack of
                    water. The reason in part as I take it, <lb/>of the water's failing so much is a
                    horizontal rock <lb/>which lies a little underground, I believe, over much
                    <lb/>of the country.</p>

                    fifteen miles. About <lb/>one mile from Barclay's is a sawmill occupied and

                    <lb/>No great variations in the land except gradually de-<lb/>clining towards

                    <lb/>after that, a declension of soil took place and pro-<lb/>gressed until it
                    became, as I thought, very poor, <lb/>rough, and hilly, until we came to one
                        <persName ref="dunc1">Duncan's</persName>, <lb/>where we fed our horses and
                    dined from the supply <lb/>of our bags, it being eighteen miles; from thence
                    to<lb/> one <persName ref="bove1">Bovear's</persName>, where three of our
                    company lodged. <lb/><persName ref="jcoop1">James Cooper</persName> and myself
                    rode six miles further to <lb/>my cousin, <persName ref="acoat1">Abner
                        Coats's</persName>, who is just newly settled in <lb/>the woods; has got
                    about ten acres of land cleared <lb/>and seems in a likely way to make a living.
                    He was <lb/>very kind and glad to see me; tied up our horses, <lb/>fed them with
                    bran and cut corn-tops, with which <lb/>they seemed to do very well. All this
                    stage appeared <lb/>to me to be very poor, until we turned off the road <lb/>and
                    got near <persName ref="acoat1">Abner's</persName>, where the land appears
                    tolera-<lb/>bly level and pretty good soil. We crossed one large <lb/>and one
                    lesser stream running to the right, called <lb/><geogName ref="conyc"
                        >Conyconeys</geogName>. Divers places the road was intolerable <lb/>for
                    short steep hills,--so much so that going down <lb/>some of them, leading our
                    horses, we seemed in dan-<lb/>ger of their falling down upon us. This day, rode
                    <lb/>thirty-four miles.</p>

                    little guts descending out of the mountains, that <lb/>for bad traveling it
                    exceeded all I have yet met with. <lb/>We crossed two large streams, the first

                    middling, being much <lb/>covered with white oak. At this place we arrived
                    <lb/>about two in the afternoon; appearing to be good quar-<lb/>ters for
                    ourselves and horses, we stayed all night, and <lb/>lodged comfortably in the

                    near forty-five degrees of eleva-<lb/>tion. Going down the hill I discovered my
                    mare had <lb/>lost one of her shoes, and by the time I got to this <lb/>place
                    she began to limp pretty much, and no smith <lb/>here. The prospect looks dull

                    mediately after leaving <placeName ref="frank">Franklin</placeName> we crossed
                        <geogName ref="french">French <lb/>Creek</geogName>, and soon entered very
                    poor, barren land <lb/>which continued for several miles; then came to land
                    <lb/>more level than any we have seen the west side of <lb/><geogName

                    level to be very good for wheat, <lb/>and exceeding thick set with small timber,
                    partic-<lb/>larly quaking asp. About twelve miles from <placeName ref="frank"
                        >Frank-<lb/>lin</placeName> we came across a cabin and a few acres of
                    <lb/>ground cleared, where the people looked clean and <lb/>decent; had
                    abundance of watermelons with which <lb/>they regaled us plentifully without
                    charge. A few <lb/>more cabins and small lots cleared we saw on our way
                    <lb/>between <geogName ref="french">French Creek</geogName> and <geogName
                        key="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogName>. Rattlesnakes <lb/>abound here. I saw a
                    large one of about three feet <lb/>nine inches long, and about as thick as my
                    wrist. I <lb/>alighted and killed it; cut off the rattles, being nine.
                    <lb/>Great numbers of wild tur-<lb/>keys are here; we saw several flocks
                    containing forty <lb/>or more and might easily have shot some of them if <lb/>we
                    had had guns and ammunition.</p>
                <p> We arrived at <persName ref="jtitu1">Titus's</persName> a little before sunset;
                    got our <lb/>horses to good pasture, and lodged comfortably in his <lb/>barn.

                    acres of land, the most of it a rich bottom; <lb/>has got about twenty-six acres
                    of excellent corn in <lb/>the ground, a considerable quantity of wheat in stack;
                    <lb/>a spring of excellent water near the door, large enough <lb/>to turn a
                    breast-mill; so that upon the whole I think <lb/>this farm likely in time to be
                    of most inestimable <lb/>value, <geogName ref="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogName> being
                    boatable this high, which is <lb/>about eighteen miles from the mouth where it

                    morning, we set off early and <lb/>rode twenty-nine miles near the mouth of a
                    large <lb/>stream called <geogName ref="broke">Brokenstraw</geogName>, where we
                    pitched our <lb/>tent, kindled a fire, and lodged in the woods. I am <lb/>not
                    furnished with language or memory to describe <lb/>the particulars of this day's
                    journey, but may en-<lb/>deavor to note some particulars. After leaving
                        <persName ref="jtitu1">Titus's</persName>
                    <lb/>we rode two miles to a newly erected mill and saw-<lb/>mill on a branch of
                        <geogName ref="oilcr">Oil Creek</geogName>, which the Holland <lb/>Company
                    have erected in order to supply the new <lb/>settlers with flour, etc., and
                    divers of them come there <lb/>twenty, twenty-five, and more miles with bags of
                    <lb/>grain on a horse, to be ground; there being no road <lb/>that any carriage
                    can pass, and indeed, (to such who <lb/>have not seen those mountainous new
                    countries), it <lb/>would appear to impraticable to pass with a single
                    <lb/>horse. After leaving the mill we soon entered a<lb/>forest of white pine,
                    hemlock and divers other sorts <lb/>of timber not necessary to mention, and
                    great part of <lb/>our ride this day was through timber of that sort; <lb/>some
                    of the way tolerably level, but a great part of it <lb/>such mountains thickly
                    set with stones and rocks, <lb/>which together with the interlocking of the
                    roots <lb/>of the timber, a little comparable to a corn-rid-<lb/>dle, and the
                    deep swampy guts, it was with difficulty <lb/>we got along over roots and rock
                    the cavities be-<lb/>tween them being so deep and so close together that<lb/>had
                    our horses got their legs in, (and this to appear-<lb/>ance seemed almost
                    unavoidable), they must have <lb/>been broken. But I suppose the way to be much
                    bet-<lb/>ter than it was two years ago, being now a cut path <lb/>all the way,
                    which was not the case then. In many <lb/>places the timber is, I believe, from
                    one hundred to <lb/>two hundred feet high, and thickly set, insomuch that <lb/>a
                    great part of the face of the ground and rocks <lb/>is scarcely ever saluted
                    with the luminous rays of the <lb/>sun, which I think is the reason of the rocks
                    and old <lb/>logs being very thick set with coats of moss; and as <lb/> the seed
                    of different kinds of trees falls on this moss <lb/>which the rocks and old logs
                    contain, there being <lb/>moisture enough contained in it to occasion a
                    vegeta-<lb/>tion, the body or trunk ascends and the roots crawl<lb/> on the
                    surface of the rock or log to the edge, and then <lb/>descend into the gorund,
                    and great numbers of that <lb/>description are grown into large trees the roots
                    of <lb/>which clasp a rock a little similar to the clasp of an <lb/>eagles claw;
                    and on many of these rocks there are <lb/>several trees. I saw one rock about
                    twenty feet in <lb/>diameter, which had seven trees on it, some of <lb/>which
                    were two or three feet over and perhaps <lb/>one hundred and fifty feet high and
                    the rock <lb/>ten or twelve feet high. I think we saw neither <lb/>house nor
                    improvement for twenty miles; neither <lb/>can I suppose much of it will be
                    settled for many <lb/>years to come, We came on the <geogName ref="broke"
                        >Brokenstraw</geogName> about<lb/> seven miles above the mouth and rode sixe
                    miles down <lb/>the stream to the place of our encampment, through <lb/>a very
                    rich bottom. As I rode along this day <lb/>I frequently experienced a transition
                    of ideas; <lb/>while passing through the dark shades of the thick <lb/>and lofty
                    timber which sometimes appeared like a <lb/>desolate, gloomy wilderness
                    comparable to the gloom <lb/>of eternal night; and other times so great, so
                    grand, <lb/>so magnificent that it became truly transporting.</p>

                    without taking breakfast or <lb/>feeding our horses. Rode down the aforesaid
                    creek <lb/>almost to the mouth and with some difficulty got <lb/>along, the
                    Indian path up the river being in many <lb/>places hard to be discovered, to a
                    place called <placeName ref="warre">War-<lb/>ren</placeName> [now the county
                    seat of Warren county], being a <lb/>newly laid out town, but without much
                    building ex-<lb/>cept one cabin and a storehouse built by the Hol<lb/>land
                    Company near the mouth of another large <lb/>stream called <geogName ref="concr"
                        >Connowongo</geogName>. Here we breakfasted <lb/>and fed our horses. The
                    people in the cabin were <lb/>very kind, made our chocolate for us and gave us
                    <lb/>some good pigeon soup. [Distance] nine miles. Here <lb/>we hired a guide;
                    rode over the <geogName ref="concr">Connowongo</geogName>, and <lb/>followed our
                    guide with undescribable difficulty <lb/>about sixteen miles to <placeName
                        key="cornp">Cornplanter's settlement</placeName>. The <lb/>logs, the brush,
                    and thick-set young timber rendered <lb/>this stage extremely difficult and
                    tiresome; almost a <lb/>continual succession of logs, in many places three or
                    <lb/>four in a perch, as high as our horses could step over, <lb/>and many of
                    them they had to jump; and the young <lb/>growth being so thick that if we were
                    two rods apart <lb/>we would have to call out to each other in fear of
                    be-<lb/>ing lost. About an hour before sunset we reached the <lb/>new house
                    which <persName ref="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> is getting built, and
                    <lb/>the schoolhouse where <persName ref="hsimm1">Henry Simmons</persName>
                    teaches the <lb/>young Indians, at which place we met with Henry, <lb/>greatly
                    to our mutual comfort, and where we tarried <lb/>all night in the schoolhouse.
                    At this place there are <lb/>several comfortable houses building, it being about
                    <lb/>one mile lower down the river than where <placeName ref="cornp"

                    inhabitants of the town just above, pro-<lb/>posed to move. <persName

                    friends and visited several <lb/>familieis of Indians in their houses and
                    cabins. One <lb/>Indian, <persName ref="ijohn1">John</persName>, has built
                    himself a snug house and <lb/>kitchen, the logs well-hewn and the joists and
                    boards <lb/>planed, [with] sash and glass windows. He has <lb/>mowed and made
                    two good stacks of hay, fenced in <lb/>several acres of ground in which he has
                    good corn; <lb/>and several others of them are improving in their
                    <lb/>buildings, fencing, etc. We have fared very well <lb/>this day on provision
                    wellcooked by <persName ref="hjack1">Halliday Jack-<lb/>son</persName>; also
                    walked about and reviewed the improve-<lb/>ment made by our young friends in
                    this wilderness <lb/>country, which appears considerable. And although<lb/>I
                    think the spot they are settled upon is much infer-<lb/>ior to many other places
                    in these parts for fertility, <lb/>yet their corn and buckwheat are good; [they]
                    had <lb/>pretty good oats, have a considerable quantity of hay <lb/>procured, a
                    large garden of good vegetables, and have <lb/>about five acres of ground
                    cleared and plowed ready <lb/>to sow wheat. They have got a comfortable
                    two-<lb/>story house to live in, and several other necessary<lb/>buildings.</p>

                    dis-<lb/>tant chiefs being collected before we came. Before <lb/>we sat in
                    council, walked about, viewing some of the <lb/>Indian cottages and their dress,
                    which would take <lb/>more time to describe than I am at this time

                    others to <lb/>council; and in a short time they collected in a part <lb/>of
                        <persName ref="cornp2">Cornplanter's</persName> house or cabin, perhaps to
                    the num-<lb/>ber of thirty or more. We all sat down in stillness a <lb/>short
                    space, when the old chief stood up (his son <lb/><persName ref="habee1">Henry
                        O'Beil</persName> interpreting), and addressed us in sub-<lb/>stance as
                    follows:</p></div>

                <p> "Brothers, I am glad the good Spirit has favored <lb/>you all with health in
                    your long journey to come and <lb/>see us and take us by the hand, so that we
                    may <lb/>brighten the chain of friendship; and now some of <lb/>us are
                    collected, we should be glad to hear what you <lb/>have to say to us.”</p>
                        </div>
                        <div type="narrative">
                <p> We then informed them that we had taken a long <lb/>journey to see our young men
                    who were settled <lb/>among our Indian brothers, and that we had not <lb/>much
                    that we knew of to say to the Indians; only to <lb/>know from themselves how
                    they liked our young <lb/>men being amongst them, and whether they thought
                    <lb/>they were likely to be useful to them or not. We <lb/>then had our
                    certificate read and interpreted to them, <lb/>with which they expressed
                    satisfaction; and we hav-<lb/>ing agreed upon a short piece of advice or queries
                    to <lb/>lay before them, which we had in writing, it was read <lb/>by paragraphs
                    and interpreted to them as follows:</p></div>
                        <div type="letter">
                <p> "Brothers, you have now heard that our coming <lb/>here was to see how you and
                    our young men who <lb/>live amongst you are getting along. We are glad the
                    <lb/>Good Spirit has favored us to meet you in health, and <lb/>given us this
                    opportunity of taking you by the hand <lb/>and brightening the chain of
                    friendship. Now broth-<lb/>ers, we should like to hear from your own mouths if
                    <lb/>you are quite satisfied with our young men living <lb/>amongst you. They
                    came here with a hope of being <lb/>useful, by instructing you in a better way
                    of manag-<lb/>ing your land and providing for yourselves and your <lb/>cattle.
                    We desire you to speak freely brothers. It <lb/>has been some satisfaction to us
                    in riding through <lb/>your town to see marks of industry taking place; that
                    <lb/>you are building better and warmer houses to live in; <lb/>and that so much
                    of your cleared land is planted with <lb/>corn, potatoes, beans, squashes,
                    cucumbers, etc., and <lb/>to see these articles kept in good order. Brothers, we
                    <lb/>observe where your new houses are building, that the <lb/>timber is very
                    much cut off a rich flat which we wish <lb/>you encouraged to clear and make it
                    fit for plowing. <lb/>We believe it to be very good land for wheat, as well
                    <lb/>as corn, and as the white people are settling around <lb/>you, the deer and
                    other wild game will grow scarce <lb/>and more difficult to be taken. We
                    therefore hope <lb/>that more of your men will assist in clearing land,
                    <lb/>fencing it, planting it with corn, and sowing it with <lb/>wheat. You will
                    then have a supply of provision <lb/>more certain to depend upon than hunting.
                    Broth-<lb/>ers, we were pleased to see your stock of cattle in-<lb/>creased; the
                    rich bottoms on the river will be plenty <lb/>for them to live on in the summer
                    season, but as your <lb/>winters are long and cold, it will require something
                    <lb/>for them to live on in the winter. Now the white <lb/>people keep their
                    cattle on hay, on straw and on <lb/>corn-fodder. Straw you cannot get until you
                    raise <lb/>wheat or other grain; the rich bottoms, if they were <lb/>put in
                    order, would produce a great deal of hay; but <lb/>for an immediate supply, we
                    think, if as soon as you <lb/>gather your corn you would cut the stalks close at
                    <lb/>the ground, bind them up in small bundles, and put <lb/>them in stack, as
                    our young men do, they would keep <lb/>the cattle part of the cold weather.
                    Brothers, we <lb/>are glad to see a quantity of new fence made this <lb/>summer,
                    near where our young men live, and we <lb/>would not have you get discouraged at
                    the labor it <lb/>takes; for if you will clear a little more land every
                    <lb/>year and fence it, you will soon get enough to raise <lb/>what bread you
                    want, as well as some for grass to <lb/>make hay for winter. Brothers, we
                    understand you <lb/>are desirous to discourage whiskey from being <lb/>brought
                    amongst you, with which we are much <lb/>pleased, and should be glad you could
                    entirely keep <lb/>it away; for to get it, you give your money which <lb/>you
                    should have to buy clothes with, and to buy <lb/>oxen and plows with to work
                    your land; and it does <lb/>not do you any good."</p></div>
                        <div type="narrative">
                <p> After which a solemn silence took place, in which <lb/>I thought I felt love to
                    flow to the poor natives, <lb/>accompanied by a strong desire that they might be
                    <lb/>prevailed upon to wholly decline the drinking of <lb/>distilled spirits;
                    for truly I think until some reforma-<lb/>tion in that respect takes place
                    amongst them, the <lb/>solid ground on which we can expect their
                    profit-<lb/>able civilization is small; and though I felt as I did, <lb/>it
                    seemed discouraging to offer anything to them on <lb/>the occasion, considering
                    my own inability and the <lb/>imperfect interpreter we had--being one who hath a
                    <lb/>strong inclination to the evil habit himself. So I had <lb/>liked to have
                    omitted saying anything, until my friend <lb/><persName ref="jshar1">Joshua
                        Sharples</persName>, whispered to me and told me if I <lb/>had anything to
                    say to them not to omit it. I then <lb/>addressed them in substance as
                    follows:</p></div>
                        <div type="speech">
                <p> "Brothers, your brothers, the Quakers, who have <lb/>come a long way to see you,
                    believe that the Great <lb/>Spirit made both white men and red men, and placed
                    <lb/>them on this great island, gave them many good <lb/>things to live upon
                    such as grain, flesh, fruit, etc., and <lb/>
                    <pb n="483" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_08"/> also gave them understanding hearts. And
                    we also <lb/>believe that his design or intention was that we <lb/>should love
                    and serve him, and not only love him <lb/>and our own people but love and be at
                    peace with all <lb/>people of all nations and colors. But some white <lb/>men
                    became very cunning and sought out new inven-<lb/>tions, one of which was making
                    rum, whiskey, <lb/>brandy, etc., out of the good things that he had given
                    <lb/>them, which at first was used in very small quantities <lb/>as medicine;
                    but as it became more plenty, many <lb/>white men got to love it and drink more
                    of it inso-<lb/>much that they became drunk and neglected their <lb/>business;
                    many of their wives and children suffered <lb/>in want of food and clothing, and
                    it seemed to be the <lb/>beginner or forerunner of almost every bad
                    practice.</p>
                <p> Now brothers, some of your friends, the Quakers, <lb/>many years since were
                    favored to see the mischief <lb/>that rum and whiskey had done, and believed it
                    right <lb/>for them not to drink any more, and have found by <lb/>more than
                    twenty years' experience that they can do <lb/>better without it than with it.
                    And seeing the mis-<lb/>chief it did to others, and how much better they
                    <lb/>themselves did without it, believed it right to per-<lb/>suade others to do
                    so too; and as we love our Indian <lb/>brothers, and seeing their land is much
                    sold and <lb/>white people settling all round them whereby the <lb/>deer and
                    other game is likely to become so scarce <lb/>that they cannot live by hunting
                    much longer, we <lb/>were drawn in compassion to invite some of our young
                    <lb/>men to come and live amongst you, in order to in-<lb/>struct you in the
                    useful ways of the white people who <lb/>have now been some time with you. But
                    we under-<lb/>stand that some bad white men let Indians have <lb/>whiskey and
                    that many of them love it so much that <lb/>they often get drunk and are wicked.
                    Brothers, we <lb/>wish you would not hearken to those bad men who <lb/>want you
                    to buy their whiskey, nor give way to your <lb/>own love for it, but stand
                    against it and not use any <lb/>of it; for if you do, your friends, the Quakers,
                    will <lb/>be discouraged and hang down their heads and go <lb/>and leave you.
                    But if you will stand against it and <lb/>not use it, become sober men, they
                    will be willing to <lb/>assist and instruct you what they can."</p></div>
                        <div type="narrative">
                <p> I believe the interpreter endeavored to render it <lb/>into the Indian language
                    as well as he could, though <lb/>he appeared somewhat convicted; and I also
                    think <lb/>they understood it pretty well, as there appeared a <lb/>general
                    concurrence by their usual nod and sound on <lb/>such occasions, and by what the
                    old chief said to us <lb/>after, on our asking them if they had anything to say
                    <lb/>to us, he replied that <persName ref="hsimm1">Henry Simmons</persName> had
                    told him <lb/>some time ago that he intended to go home this fall, <lb/>(Henry
                    having taught school at <placeName ref="cornp">Cornplanter's
                    village</placeName>), <lb/>and that he could not give us an answer until he knew
                    <lb/>whether Henry would go or not. We then agreed to <lb/>be a little time by
                    ourselves. They left us a few min-<lb/>utes and we laid the matter close to
                        <persName ref="hsimm1">Henry</persName>. He then <lb/>told us that he
                    believed it was his duty to come here <lb/>and he now believed it was his place
                    to go home, <lb/>which we could not gainsay, though we felt sorry the
                    <lb/>Indian children should be left without an instructor. <lb/>The chiefs were
                    called in again, and tenderly informed <lb/>of Henry's intention of returning.
                        <persName ref="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> then <lb/>replied if it was
                    right, he could not say against it, but <lb/>was afraid he should not have help
                    enough to keep <lb/>away the whiskey, as Henry had been a great help to <lb/>him
                    in that, and that he thought the Indians would <lb/>now mind him more than they
                    would one of them; <lb/>and then said that when our young men came first
                    <lb/>amongst them some of their warriors did not like it, <lb/>but now he
                    believed they all liked it, and all <lb/>spoke very well of them, and wished the
                    young <lb/>men to tell us if any of the young Indians or others <lb/>behaved bad
                    to them. They then all rose up and in <lb/>a friendly manner shook hands with us
                    and did what <lb/>they call "cover the council fire." Then one of their
                    <lb/>women brought in a large loaf of unleavened wheat <lb/>bread and a tin cup
                    full of pretty good butter, on <lb/>which we dined and took our departure up the
                    river. <lb/>Halliday Jackson, James Cooper, and myself walked, <lb/>the others
                    all went back in the canoes we came down in. <lb/>Arrived at the young men's

                        this visit, was about 60 to <lb/>65 years old. He was of half-blood only,
                        the son of a white man <lb/>named <persName ref="jobai1">John
                            O'Bail</persName>, a <placeName ref="mohva">Mohawk Valley</placeName>
                        trader. He is believed to <lb/>have been with the French in the defeat of
                            <persName ref="ebrad1">Braddock</persName>, in 1755, <lb/>and he
                        afterwards took part with the British, in the War of the <lb/>Revolution.
                        After that, however, he devoted himself to peace, and <lb/>refused to fight.
                        In the Indian disturbances from 1791 to 1794, he <lb/>kept the <orgName

                        was considered to be about 100 <lb/>years old. The accounts of him say that
                        "he deplored the evils <lb/>of intemperance, and exerted himself to suppress
                        it."]</note></p>

                    the week. Have not gone much <lb/>out of the house to-day. Sat down with the
                    young<lb/>men at their usual time of holding their meeting, <lb/>which to me and
                    I believe to others was a solid, <lb/>strengthening time. A little after night,
                        <persName ref="jshar1">Joshua <lb/>Sharples</persName> went out of the house
                    and just as he came <lb/>in, the trap-door of the cellar being open, he
                    stepped<lb/> in it and fell with the back of his head against one of <lb/>the
                    joists or sleepers, and so down into the cellar. <lb/>We all made what haste we
                    could down, finding him <lb/>stunned and senseless. We were exceedingly
                    <lb/>alarmed, got some camphor, bathed his temples and <lb/>other places so that
                    in about two or three minutes <lb/>he came to so as to speak, but knew not that
                    any-<lb/> thing was the matter, or where he was, for a con-<lb/>siderable time.
                    At length his understanding re-<lb/>turned, but he could not all the evening
                    recollect <lb/>falling, being a good deal hurt. Our getting away <lb/>from her
                    as soon as we proposed, [now] looks doubt-<lb/> ful; but it is a great comfort
                    to us to find him as well <lb/>as he appears to be. Went to bed and I slept with
                    <lb/>him in some hopes he may be better in the morning.</p>

                    the day and appeared very much pleased <lb/>in being in our company and viewing
                    a map which <lb/>we had with us. Soon got to understand it so that <lb/>they
                    could point out almost any of the rivers and <lb/>lakes. About noon Cornplanter
                    came and brought us <lb/>a quarter of venison and two pigeons. Offered to
                    <lb/>send some of his people to pilot us to Buffalo, but we <lb/>could not tell
                    him when we could go, not knowing <lb/>when our friend would be able to travel.
                    About the <lb/>middle of the afternoon they all took an affectionate

                        <persName ref="jshar1">Joshua</persName> appearing some better,
                    <lb/>eighteen or twenty of the Indians came to see us and <lb/>bade us farewell.
                    About one o'clock we set off, <persName ref="hjack1">Hal-<lb/>liday
                        Jackson</persName> bearing us company. We took an <lb/>affectionate farewell
                    of our other two friends, after <lb/>an uniting opportunity just before parting.
                    Rode <lb/>about four miles up the river through middling good <lb/>land to the
                    house of one of the old chiefs who was <lb/>with us yesterday, and who had his
                    horse standing <lb/>hitched ready to pilot us up the river to a small
                    set-<lb/>tlement of Indians. On riding along we discovered <lb/>they had the day
                    before opened and cut the path <lb/>wider and better for several miles just on
                    our ac-<lb/>count; and on our way we passed a new settlement, <lb/>made this

                    excel-<lb/>lent land. Where he lives he has cleared and fenced <lb/>two or three
                    acres and got it in with corn and vines. <lb/>After crossing the river we rode
                    to another chief's <lb/>house where there are several cabins, and pitched our
                    <lb/>tent and lodged on the river bank. They were kind <lb/>to us in their way,
                    and gave us two very good squir-<lb/> rels. This being ten miles up the
                    river.</p>

                    <date when="1799-09-18">18<emph rend="italics">th.</emph></date> Being a rainy
                    morning, we set off having <lb/><persName ref="sunfi1">Sunfish</persName> and
                        <persName ref="hjack1">Halliday Jackson</persName> for our guides, which
                    <lb/>we found to be very useful to use before night, it be-<lb/>ing a very wet
                    day and much of the way so swampy <lb/>and difficult that we should have been
                    much beset <lb/>without them. Abundance of the way through, the <lb/>wilderness
                    is so stopped up with wind falls of timber, <lb/>many of which are so large in
                    low ground and fallen <lb/>one on another for a mile together, that to a
                    stranger <lb/>it would seem altogether impassable. Many of these <lb/>with great
                    difficulty we have to jump our horses over, <lb/>and perhaps in mud half leg
                    deep; and many of <lb/>them were so large no horse could leap them. We <lb/>went
                    up the river three miles and then took up a <lb/>valley about twelve miles, down
                    which a creek of <lb/>about the size of our branch of Brandywine runs.
                    <lb/>Excellent good land all the way up, there being <lb/>abundance of sugar
                    maple, beech, ash, birch, and <lb/>bass. I have seen sugar maple in abundance
                    that <lb/>were three feet over and near one hundred feet high; <lb/>the other
                    timber in proportion. We then ascended <lb/>a very high mountain; good land up
                    it, and on the <lb/>top still good, being covered with very heavy, lofty
                    <lb/>timber some of which is white pine, some poplar, <lb/>and the other as
                    before mentioned. Before we as-<lb/>cended the mountain we came to the heads of
                    springs<lb/>within a few perches of each other, some of which<lb/>run into the
                        <geogName ref="alleg">Allegheny</geogName> and some into the <geogName
                        key="catar">Cattarau-<lb/>gus</geogName>. The former empties into the
                        <geogName ref="ohior">Ohio</geogName>; the latter <lb/>into <geogName
                        key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName> and so down the river <geogName ref="stlar"
                        >St. Lawrence</geogName>. <lb/>In some places, abundance of wild cherry
                    three and <lb/>four feet in diameter, perhaps sixty and some eighty <lb/>feet to
                    the first limb. But as I do not intend to give <lb/>a minute description of the
                    land, water, and timber, <lb/>only to give a sketch of what appeared remarkable,
                    <lb/>suffice it to say that in this day's ride, (which was a <lb/>very wet one
                    through abundance of swampy land), I <lb/>think the land was generally good and
                    heavy loaded <lb/>with timber. This day's ride, twenty-four miles. <lb/>Pitched
                    our tent by a spring amongst lofty timber, <lb/>and just after we got our fire
                    made and tent raised, it <lb/>began to rain very fast, and was an exceeding wet
                    <lb/>night, accompanied with a great wind or storm inso-<lb/>much that we heard
                    the tree falling almost all <lb/>around us. Our situation appeared to be
                    somewhat <lb/>trying; but as we had no alternative, soon composed <lb/>oursevles
                    and went to sleep.</p>

                    Erie</geogName>, 27 miles, and pitched our tent on <lb/>the margin thereof. We
                    passed some very bad, <lb/>swampy road in the morning. The timber and land
                    <lb/>much as yesterday and almost all the way, so far as <lb/>I have come
                    through the New York State, there ap-<lb/> pear to be very few stones. But after
                    riding 8 or 10 <lb/>miles this day, we came to abundance of the most
                    <lb/>beautiful poplar trees I have ever seen; and about <lb/>one mile before we
                    crossed <geogName ref="catar">Cattaraugus River</geogName> we <lb/>came into a
                    bottom of very rich land, wherein abun-<lb/>dance of black walnut stand, many of
                    them three, <lb/>four, five, and perhaps some six feet in diameter, and
                    <lb/>sixty or severty feet to the first limb. Crossed <geogName ref="catar"
                        >Cat-<lb/>taraugus</geogName>, being ten miles from our lodging, and rode
                    <lb/>ten more to an Indian village. Stopped awhile with <lb/>them, but as their
                    chief was not at home we soon <lb/>left them, and rode seven miles through a low
                    piece <lb/>of land heavily timbered with hemlock, sugar ma-<lb/>ple, etc., to
                    the lake aforesaid, which, to be sure, at <lb/>first view exhibited a grand
                    prospect here in the <lb/>wilderness, appearing both as to motion and sound
                    <lb/>like the ocean. Had a good supper of chocolate, <lb/>cooked by <persName

                    <date when="1799-09-20">20<emph rend="italics">th</emph></date>. Rode 28 miles
                    down the lake on the beach <lb/>or margin thereof to the mouth of <geogName
                        key="buffc1">Buffalo Creek</geogName>. <lb/>Crossed it in a boat and swam
                    our horses over, it be-<lb/>ing a very deep channel, about 30 or 40 yards wide.
                    <lb/>Lodged at <persName ref="jelli2">Joseph Elliot</persName>'s headquarters,
                    he being the <lb/>principal surveyor or superintendent of the Holland
                    <lb/>Company's business. Were kindly entertained free <lb/>of cost. This day's
                    ride down the lake was a de-<lb/>lightful journey, affording such a variety of
                    prospect <lb/>of the wonderful works of nature. Some places the <lb/>land at the
                    margin of the lake appeared to be pretty <lb/>level; in most others there was a
                    wall on our right <lb/>hand, in many places 50, some 60, and some near, if
                    <lb/>not quite, 100 feet high and almost perpendicular; <lb/>the beach or margin
                    from the water to the wall, <lb/>very diverse for width, some of 20 yards, some
                    10, <lb/>some 5, and in several places the wall butted into the <lb/>water,
                    where we several times had to ride in round <lb/>the points of rocks knee-deep
                    and sometimes belly-<lb/>deep; and in one or two places between a large
                    pyra-<lb/>mid of rock and the wall on the right, the pyramind <lb/>appearing
                    conical or in the form of a sugar loaf about <lb/>ten feet in diameter at its
                    base, and about twelve <lb/>feet high. These cones, I believe, are made by the
                    <lb/>dashing of waves, together with the freezing of <lb/>the water in the
                    winter, in the smooth joints of the <lb/>rocks, whereby abundance of them fall
                    down, parting <lb/> off from their fellows in smooth, perpendicular <lb/>points.
                    The high, perpendicular wall exhibits a curi-<lb/>ous view; the stone appears to
                    be principally com-<lb/>posed of slate and limestone in different regular
                    <lb/>strata of layers. The bottom or lowermost rocks that <lb/> I discovered in
                    most places are limestone, curiously <lb/>laid in a horizontal form and nicely
                    jointed in <lb/>squares of eight, ten, or twelve feet in diameter, the<lb/>
                    <pb n="502" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_11"/> joints or vaccuums between them mostly
                    about an <lb/>inch wide. Some places we found them to extend into <lb/>the lake;
                    other places not quite to the edge of it; and <lb/>in others not within ten
                    yards of it. Where they ex-<lb/>tended to the lake, they formed a beautiful
                    level to <lb/>ride upon. The next layer or stratum is slate about <lb/>ten feet
                    perpendicular. In some places it appeared <lb/>very shelly or near rotten; in
                    many others, excel-<lb/>lent slate in great quantities either for flagging or
                    <lb/>covering for houses. Then one general layer of lime-<lb/>stone about
                    fifteen or eighteen inches thick; then <lb/>pretty generally slate or other
                    stone to the top of the <lb/>wall or abutment, all which are curiously jointed
                    in <lb/>smooth squares or columnes some two feet square, <lb/>some five, and
                    some in oblong squares two or three <lb/>feet by eight or ten. And as the water
                    in wet times <lb/>penetrates down those joints, I suppose it freezes in <lb/>the
                    winter and bursts off the columns, which fall <lb/>down on the margin of the
                    lake, in many places large <lb/>bodies of them together as much as several
                    square <lb/>rods, and the timber on the top with them. In many <lb/>places the
                    trees were hanging by one half of the<lb/>roots with their tops below a level,
                    and some right <lb/>top downwards and not touching the bottom. In <lb/>many
                    places by the continual dahsing of the waves <lb/> against the rocks they are
                    worn in curious forms.</p>

                    as yesterday, but similar beds <lb/>of limestone. This <geogName ref="niagr"
                        >Niagara River</geogName> is the great outlet <lb/>of all the northwestern
                    lakes and waters, which <lb/>makes a very great river above a mile wide and of
                    <lb/>great depth, running very rapidly. We crossed the <lb/>river in a boat,
                    which the heavy current drives across <lb/>in a few minutes, which to some of
                    our company ap-<lb/>peared a little terrifying; and then rode up on the <lb/>
                    margin of the lake on the other side about eight <lb/>miles, which appears to be
                    pretty level except some <lb/>very high banks of sand and a general bed of
                    lime-<lb/>stone lying in a form similar to the lower bed <lb/>on the other side.
                    Then turned off from the lake <lb/>about a mile to <persName ref="dpoun1">Daniel
                        Pound</persName>'s, where four of us <lb/>dined and left some linen to be
                    washed (<persName ref="hjack1">Halliday <lb/>Jackson</persName> and <persName
                        key="hhart1">Hugh Hartshorn</persName> having part with us <lb/> at the
                    ferry and gone down to view the great <geogName ref="niagf">Falls</geogName>).
                    <lb/>We then rode to <persName ref="ascho1">Asa Schooly</persName>'s, where we
                    met with<lb/>our beloved friends <persName ref="wblak1">Wiiliam

                    <lb/>and <persName ref="jpaxs1">Jacob Paxson</persName>, who we heard had
                    arrived two <lb/>days before us. Here we all propose to stay this <lb/>night,
                    our kind friend and landlord appearing to have <lb/>things comfortably
                    convenient about him. They said <lb/>they could contrive for bedding for us all;
                    but <lb/><persName ref="tstew1">Thomas Stewardson</persName> and myself were
                    desirous to sleep <lb/>on the floor with our blankets, believing it would be
                    <lb/>best on several accounts; but we could not do it with-<lb/>out hurting our
                    friend's feelings, so consented to take <lb/>a bed. But when we got to the bed
                    chamber by our-<lb/>selves, we found a good clean bed and clothing, which
                    <lb/>we examined, and found a thin straw bed on the <lb/>sacking. We then took
                    off the feather bed and laid <lb/>it in the corner of the room, expecting we
                    should not <lb/>be discovered. But our kind friend came into the <lb/>room and
                    found the bed in the corner, but did not any <lb/>more insist upon our
                    compliance with their request.</p>

                    week. Stayed and attended <lb/>their meeting, which is held in the house of our
                    <lb/>friend, <persName ref="ascho1">Asa Schooly</persName>, where we lodged,
                    which to me <lb/>was a dull time, though some lively communications
                    <lb/>therein. After dinner I took an affection farewell <lb/>of <persName

                    hope was a time of prof-<lb/>itable instruction to some of them. On taking a

                    especially for their <lb/> women, many of them going four or five miles on

                    such a state that I should have thought <lb/>scarcely fit to travel far on

                    with great solem-<lb/>nity. In this conference I was more fully convinced
                    <lb/>that there is a small number of seeking, religiously <lb/>minded Friends in
                    both places, and that if they <lb/>abode in the patience and perseverance, the
                    way <lb/>would open ere long for the establishment of a <lb/>monthly meeting
                    amongst them. But the rest of my <lb/>brethren believed the time was already

                    view a great curiosity called <lb/>the whirlpool. On our way we met with an
                    acceptable <lb/>repast on excellent peaches. We came to the bank of <lb/> the
                    river, which I believe is three hundred feet above <lb/>the water, nearly
                    perpendicular, on which we had <lb/>a fair view of that astonishing place, the
                    river rush-<lb/>ing with great impetuosity against the bank or wall <lb/>of
                    rocks at a short turn in the river and then turning <lb/>in a cove of perhaps
                    ten acres in which it whirls <lb/>round and round, striving to escape at a
                    narrow pas-<lb/>sage of perhaps one hundred yards, being all the <lb/>opening
                    there is between the high hills. Into this <lb/>pool abundance of logs and
                    timber is carried and per-<lb/>haps cannot get out for some weeks. It is amazing
                    <lb/>to behold the whirls that are formed, the logs sucked <lb/>down and some
                    time after shooting up (perhaps 100 <lb/> yards from the place they went down,
                    end foremost) <lb/>fifteen or twenty feet perpendicular out of the water;
                    <lb/>that upon the whole it is an indescribably agitated <lb/>place. Returned

                    <persName ref="wlund1">William Lunday</persName> accompanied <persName
                        key="jcoop1">James Cooper</persName>
                    <lb/>and myself in order to take a satisfactory view of the <lb/>great cataract.
                    We went about three-quarters of a <lb/>mile below <geogName ref="niagf">the
                        Falls</geogName> and then descended a bank of <lb/>lime-stone rocks, I
                    suppose nearly 300 feet, which <lb/>was not quite perpendicular, to the surface
                    of the <lb/>water, some times holding by roots, some times by <lb/> twigs, and
                    some of the way down a ladder, other <lb/>times sticking our toes in the
                    cavities and holding <lb/>by the craggy parts of the rocks. When down,
                    clam-<lb/>bered along the rocks, logs, slabs, and timber up the <lb/>river to
                    the place where the water shoots over the <lb/>rock and falls 160 feet. We went
                    as far as we though <lb/>was safe, being as wet, with the spray of water and
                    <lb/>sweat, as if we had been in a heavy shower. I had <lb/> an inclination to
                    go further in behind the water, but <lb/><persName ref="wlund1"
                        >Lunday</persName> said it was dangerous; for, as he said, if the <lb/>wind
                    were to shift against us we should be in danger <lb/>of being suffocated with
                    the spray and sulphur which <lb/>smelled very strong. I though there was not
                    quite <lb/>so much danger as he alleged, believining he was a <lb/>good deal
                    timid; however, I thought best to decline, <lb/>lest I should suffer for my
                    temerity. On clambering <lb/>along the rocks by the water with a wall or
                    mountain <lb/> of rocks 160 feet high in some place over my head, <lb/>hanging
                    twelve or fifteen feet over plumb, it appeared <lb/>truly awful and dangerous,
                    which put me upon think-<lb/>ing what my view was in going into such apparent
                    <lb/> danger, as it is evident great columns of them fre-<lb/>quently break off
                    and fall down; but as I believed it <lb/>was not altogether to gratify an indle
                    curiosity, for the <lb/>whole of the prospect led me into a reverent frame of
                    <lb/>mind, admiring the wonderful works, and in some <lb/>measure adoring the
                    Great Author, I then though if <lb/>I should then be buried in oblivion, perhaps
                    my soul <lb/>was as much in a state of aspiration and adoration as <lb/> it
                    might be when the unavoidable event should take <lb/>place. This consideration
                    led me on without much <lb/>fear at that time, though naturally timid. I need
                    <lb/>not undertake to describe this wonderful phenom-<lb/>enon, as many pens
                    have been employed in setting <lb/>forth its magnitude; but as I have taken a
                    view of <lb/>the river in places many miles down, I am fully of <lb/>the min
                    dthat the <geogName ref="niagf">great Falls</geogName> at some period were nine
                    <lb/> miles farther down the river and that they are gradu-<lb/>ally wearing up,
                    and perhaps in time may drain the <lb/>great <geogName ref="lakee">Lake
                        Erie</geogName>. It is wonderful to behold the agi-<lb/>tation of the water
                    in the rapids above the falls and <lb/>also below them, column after column
                    dashing <lb/>against each other and rising a great height with <lb/>such foaming
                    and confusion that the whole appears <lb/>truly awful. We were very wet when we
                    left the <lb/> place; got on our horses and rode to <placeName ref="chipp1"
                        >Chippewa</placeName>. Fed <lb/>our horses and took a snatch ourselves, then
                    rode to <lb/><placeName ref="blacc">Black Creek settlement</placeName>,
                    twenty-four miles, and <lb/>lodged at <persName ref="amorr1">Anna

                    <lb/>an open plain full of lime-stone which doth not appear <lb/>to me to be
                    very valuable, the grass and herbage of <lb/>an inferior kind; some of the way
                    pretty good land <lb/>covered with beech and sugar maple. From thence <lb/>to
                        <geogName ref="tonne">Tonawanda</geogName>, a large stream running into

                    day's ride, thirty-six miles, in which space <lb/>we met fifteen or sixteen
                    wagons with families and <lb/>many other people moving to Upper Canada. So great
                    <lb/>is the emigration to that government.</p>
                <p>
                    <date when="1799-10-10">10<emph rend="italics">th</emph>.</date> Rode ten miles
                    along the aforesaid road <lb/>which is at least 100 feet wide. I was very much
                    <lb/>surprised to see the improvement which is made in <lb/> this new settled
                    country, particularly along this road. <lb/>I am informed it is but ten years
                    since it first began <lb/>to be settled; and now there is not half a mile
                    with-<lb/>out a house, and many of them very good ones--what <lb/>may be called
                    elegant--many capital barns; a great <lb/>deal of land is cleared and there are
                    very good cattle <lb/>in the fields. The people principally emigrated from <lb/>
                    the New England states, and this is a specimen of <lb/>their industry. When we
                    had ridden ten miles from <lb/>our lodging we parted, <persName ref="jshar1"
                        >Joshua Sharples</persName>, <persName ref="nsmit1">Nathan <lb/>
                        Smith</persName>, <persName ref="jcoop1">James Cooper</persName> and myself
                    turning off the <lb/>main road to the north in order to pay a visit to <lb/>some
                    Friends who are settled at a place called <geogName ref="mudcr">Mud <lb/>
                        Creek</geogName>. The other friends all propose to go directly <lb/>home. We
                    then rode eight miles to <persName ref="jsmit1">Jacob Smith</persName>'s;
                    <lb/>dined and rested the afternoon; here we propose to <lb/>lodge. The most of
                    the way from the great road <lb/>here, appears to be a light, sandy land, thinly
                    tim-<lb/>bered and I think may be called poor. About one <lb/>mile before we
                    came to <persName ref="jsmit1">Smith</persName>'s, we again came into <lb/>rich
                    beech and sugar maple land. Our landlord doth <lb/>not appear to be much
                    polished, but I believe is <lb/>hearty in entertaining us in his way.</p>

                    <lb/>brother <persName ref="jsmit2">Jeremiah Smith</persName>'s. When I came in
                    sight of <lb/>the house, although the barn and farm looked well, <lb/>yet the
                    house appeared so miserable I was ready to<lb/>wish I had not come into those
                    parts; but in a little <lb/>while after I entered my mind was saluted with
                    some-<lb/>thing like "Peace be to this house," and I felt myself <lb/>very happy
                    in company with the family, and believe <lb/>that divers of them live near the
                    fountains of good. <lb/>We stayed till evening and then rode two miles to

                    <lb/>farm and things about it, (though he lives in a very <lb/>poor house) I was

                    four <lb/>years last spring since he began on it in the woods, <lb/>and now he
                    has more than one hundred acres of land <lb/>fenced in, fields and meadows all
                    in, either with grain <lb/>or grass, and the most of it excellent. Has built a

                    been an unfavorable season, <lb/>they have made above two thousand lbs. of
                    cheese; <lb/>and yet he appears with his precious wife to be well <lb/>concerned
                    Friends, and is free to devote much of his <lb/>time in the service of truth.
                    Truly in this far back <lb/>settlement in the <placeName ref="genec">Genesee
                        county</placeName>, State of New York, <lb/>the appearance of things is
                    comfortable, and affords <lb/>an encouraging hope that if the few Friends here
                    set-<lb/>tled improve as well and hold up so good a light in a <lb/>religious
                    sense as they do in improving the wilder-<lb/>ness country, they may yet become
                    as "a city set <lb/>upon a hill that cannot be hid." Stayed all this day
                    <lb/>with these our valued and kind friends; wrote a let-<lb/>ter to <persName

                    <date when="1799-10-13">13<emph rend="italics">th</emph></date>, and first of

                        Comstock</persName>'s, where Friends' meeting is held, <lb/>which was large
                    this day for such a new country. It<lb/>was a favored meeting, in which the
                    gospel was <lb/>preached, and near the close I could not feel easy <lb/>without
                    requesting an opportunity with Friends, se-<lb/>lected from others, which was
                    readily compiled with, <lb/> wherein I endeavored to relieve myself of a heavy
                    <lb/>burden which I had silently borned ever since I came <lb/>into these parts,
                    on account of such a rapid increase <lb/>of the abominable practice of
                    distilling the precious <lb/> wheat into whiskey; and though I believe there are
                    <lb/>a few well concerned Friends here, yet doubts ac-<lb/>companied my mind
                    that they were too easy about <lb/>the wickedness of such a perversion of the
                    blessings <lb/>of Divine Providence; and I endeavored to put them <lb/>upon
                    nobly bearing a testimony against it, and set <lb/>the light upon the
                    candlestick, believing that the des-<lb/>truction or salvation of their country
                    very much de-<lb/>pended upon the conduct pursued in that respect. <lb/>After

                    <date when="1799-10-14">14<emph rend="italics">th</emph></date>. Rode five miles
                    through rich land and new <lb/>road. We came to a great road, and as soon as we
                    <lb/>entered it we came in sight of <placeName ref="canan"
                        >Canandaigua</placeName>, a newly <lb/>settled town containing nearly or
                    quite fifty houses. <lb/>I was surprised to see such a place in this back
                    <lb/>country. It stands on a beautifully elevated spot, <lb/>the buildings
                    generally excellent, and divers of them <lb/>would cut a very good figure on the
                    banks of the <lb/>
                    <geogName ref="schri">Schuylkill</geogName> for a country seat. The town
                    commands <lb/>a pleasant prospect of a small lake about twenty <lb/>miles long
                    and two or three wide. We rode round <lb/>the lower end of the lake and crossed
                    the outlet; <lb/>then rode nine miles to one <persName ref="gilb1"
                        >Gilbert</persName>'s tavern, a good <lb/>stage for horses. Greater part of
                    said nine miles is <lb/> very rich land, some of the timber more mixed with
                    <lb/>hickory and oak than some other places; but gen-<lb/>erally through this
                    country there is a great scarcity <lb/> of mill seats or lively streams. Then to
                        <persName ref="tlee1">Thomas <lb/>Lee</persName>'s, a kind man, his wife a
                    member of our society; <lb/>seventeen miles. About midway of this stage we <lb/>
                    passed <persName ref="jpott1">Judge Potter</persName>'s house and farm. The
                    house is <lb/>quite grand and magnificent, and was it one story <lb/>higher
                    would cut no inconsiderable fiture in one of <lb/> the most populous streets of
                        <placeName ref="phila">Philadelphia</placeName>. About <lb/>two miles beofre
                    we came to said <persName ref="tlee1">Lee</persName>'s, we crossed a <lb/>fine
                    stream running to the left, being the outlet of <lb/><geogName ref="crook"
                        >Crooked Lake</geogName>; and about one mile below the lake, <lb/>at the
                    place we crossed said stream, there is a new <lb/>mill and saw-mill which was
                    built by <persName ref="dwago1">David Wag-<lb/>oner</persName>, one of the
                    followers of <persName ref="jwilk1">Jemima Wilkinson</persName>, it <lb/>being a
                    few miles from her residence. Our quarters <lb/>for ourselves and horses at this
                    place are excellent; <lb/>and being informed that <persName ref="jjone1">Joseph
                        Jones</persName>, a young man <lb/> brought up in <placeName ref="yorkt"
                        >Yorktown</placeName>, with whom I had some <lb/>acquaintance, lived near, I
                    sent for him. He came<lb/>and spent the evening very agreeably to us both, and
                    <lb/> as there appeared to be a few Friends and some <lb/>Friendly people in
                    this settlement besides some of <lb/><persName ref="jwilk1">Jemima</persName>'s
                    followers, who are very tired of their ad-<lb/>herence, <persName ref="nsmit1"
                        >Nathan Smith</persName> felt a draft in his mind to <lb/>have a meeting
                    appointed, which was accordingly <lb/>done, to be held in the house where we
                    have put up, <lb/>to begin to-morrow at eleven o'clock. This day's <lb/>ride,
                    thirty-one miles.</p>

                    <lb/>demonstration of the spirit and with power, and I be-<lb/>lieve many hearts
                    contrited, divers who had been <lb/>and some who are adherents of <persName
                        key="jwilk1">Jemima</persName>. After <lb/>meeting walked home with

                    with him at his lodging where he has set <lb/>up his trade at a mill known by
                    the name of the <lb/>"Friends' Mill," but [which] is now private property,
                    <lb/>and will, in time, I think, be of great value, the <lb/>stream being large
                    and durable, and a fall over the <lb/>rocks of forty feet, which completely
                    answer for a <lb/> dam and head race for one grist mill, two saw mills, <lb/>and
                    a fulling mill. Returned to lodge at the same <lb/>place.</p>

                    parleyed a little about staying all night. Some <lb/>were for lodgeing there,

                    of the <lb/>house or some of his family, I was all along uneasy <lb/>to stay
                    there. The rest of my companions appearing <lb/>disposed to stay, it being then
                    three o'clock in the <lb/>afternoon, however at last I gave up to stay, and then
                    <lb/>they changed their purpose and set off, and I with <lb/> them, I feeling a

                    should <lb/>meet with any suitable place to encamp, and two of <lb/>our company
                    being infirm. But on riding about <lb/>

                    <lb/>on our left hand, and ascended a great mountain <lb/>called the <geogName

                    was led to contemplate upon <lb/>the great difference between the New England

                    affluent circumstances. Several sons, young <lb/>men grown, and have been
                    settled here, I suppose, <lb/>twelve or fourteen years; have got a good deal of
                    <lb/>excellent land, cleared perhaps by the blacks, but <lb/>they have no barn
                    nor stable fit to put a horse into; <lb/>but have ten or twelve hounds, a tame
                    wolf, etc., and <lb/>I expect spend much of their time in hunting; all of
                    <lb/>which had a tendency to increase my partiality in <lb/> favor of the
                    Yankees. But we are kindly enter-<lb/>tained here; therefore it will not be
                    proper to cast<lb/>any reflections on their economy.</p>

                    evening with us in friendly converse. The land gen-<lb/>erally good this stage,
                    and some of it excellent with<lb/>abundance of very large sugar maple. Said
                        <persName ref="jmill1">Mills</persName> is <lb/> living on said Fisher's
                    land which I think will, in time, <lb/>be a very valuable estate. He said he had
                    two years <lb/>ago six hundred dozen of wheat, and the present <lb/>year has got
                    seventeen acres of corn, which will no <lb/>doubt yield fifty or sixty bushels

                    <lb/>children, nine of whom live with him, who are <lb/>very healthy and hardy.
                    He is perhaps as successful <lb/> a hunter as there is in this State, and many
                    of the <lb/>wild beasts of the woods fall a prety to his skill, such <lb/>as
                    bears, panthers, elk, and deer. It is said and be-<lb/>lieved he killed eleven
                    elk one morning before break-<lb/>fast. One of his sons, in the ninth year of
                    his age, <lb/>killed six elk and five deer; is now in the fourteenth <lb/>year
                    of his age, has killed several bears this season. <lb/>Two of his daughters
                    killed three elk in one day; <lb/> and we have this evening feasted on the
                    product of <lb/>their skill. Said <persName ref="jmill1">Mills</persName> told

                    dinner. <persName ref="fking1">Francis King</persName> is a plain, sober-looking<lb/>
                    <pb n="548" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_21"/> man, but by some means he forfeited his
                    right of <lb/>membership with our Society before he left England. <lb/>His wife
                    died after he came here, leaving with him <lb/>seven or eight children who are
                    members. <persName ref="jbell1">John</persName>
                    <lb/>and <persName ref="mbell1">Mary Bell</persName> with six or seven children
                    are all <lb/>members. These two families with one or two more, <lb/>are in the
                    commendable practice of meeting together <lb/>once or twice a week in order to
                    pay the tribute <lb/>of worship. We sat with them in their little meet-<lb/>ing
                    and dined at <persName ref="jbell1">John Bell</persName>'s, whose wife is a
                    woman <lb/>of the most exquisite sensibility; and at our depart-<lb/>ure taking
                    leave of them [it] seemed as much as she <lb/>could bear with becoming
                    fortitude. After dinner, <lb/>walked along with <persName ref="halft1"
                        >Halftown</persName> down the <geogName ref="osweo">Osweo</geogName> six
                    <lb/>miles, where it empties into the <geogName ref="alleg"
                    >Alleghany</geogName>, and he <lb/>had left his canoe. The water being very low,
                    some <lb/>of us walked and others rode in the canoe turn about <lb/>until we
                    reached <persName ref="ahoop1">Adam Hoopes</persName>'s, fourteen miles from
                        <lb/><persName ref="fking1">King</persName>'s. The land and timber down the
                    river to here, <lb/>pretty good. Said <persName ref="ahoop1">Hoopes</persName>
                    received us very kindly in <lb/>his cabin and treated us with the best provision
                    he <lb/> had; which was venison, [and] corn, dried, pounded, <lb/>and made into
                    mush, with milk to eat with it. We <lb/>all slept on the floor of his cabin
                    before the fire, hav-<lb/>ing some of his poultry taking their repose close by
                    <lb/>us. He is a courteous man who owns 20,000 acres of <lb/>land in this
                    country, a considerable part of which is <lb/>very good, and is now beginning a
                    settlement just at <lb/>the mouth of a boatable stream called <geogName
                        key="issua">Issua</geogName>, which <lb/>perhaps in time may become a very
                    valuable estate. <lb/>He has got a large house raised but not covered, and
                    <lb/>some corn standing, and perhaps eight or ten acres <lb/>which he intends to
                    sow wheat upon.</p>

                        >Pittsburg</placeName>. We <lb/>sometimes sat up and sometimes lay down and
                    slept <lb/>between two Indians navigating us, who appeared <lb/>very dexterous,
                    and disposed to accommodate us in <lb/> every respect in their power. About
                    twelve or fifteen <lb/>miles down from the <geogName ref="issua"
                        >Issua</geogName> we stopped and dined at a<lb/>place called the <placeName
                        key="plumo">Plum-Orchard</placeName>, it being on or near <lb/>the upper end
                    of the Indian reserve. I never saw <lb/> such a place before, it containing
                    about forty or fifty <lb/>acres of exceeding rich land thickly set with trees
                    <lb/>which are loaded with excellent fruit, and abundance <lb/>on the ground,
                    now in full season. I have no doubt <lb/>but there is more than one hundred
                    cart-loads of ex-<lb/>cellent plums on which we satiated our appetites for <lb/>
                    that fruit and took some on board. Then sailed down <lb/>the river to the mouth
                    of the <geogName ref="tusqu">Tusquiatossy</geogName>, it being twen-<lb/>ty-one
                    miles from <geogName ref="issua">Issua</geogName>. There we struck up a fire,
                    <lb/>pitched our tents and slept on the river-bank, the <lb/>number of the

                    appre-<lb/>hension of the near approach of a mortal enemy. <lb/>One of our
                    company took the alarm and immediately <lb/> rose; the others believing it to be

                    early and pursued our voyage <lb/>four miles to the mouth of <geogName
                        key="tusqu">Tusquiatossy</geogName>, being a <lb/>creek (though now quite
                    dry) that runs down what <lb/> is called the <geogName ref="lvall">Little

                        >Genesinguhta</placeName>, <lb/>where we met with our beloved friends,
                        <persName ref="jtayl1">J. Taylor</persName>, <persName ref="jthom2">J.
                        <lb/>Thomas</persName>, and <persName ref="jswai1">J. Swayne</persName>, the
                    young men whom we <lb/>stationed there in order to improve the natives,
                        <persName ref="jpenn1">John <lb/> Pennock</persName> also being there some
                    time, improving some <lb/>of them in the smith- business. It was truly a very
                    <lb/>satisfactory meeting, particularly to them, they being <lb/>so long from a
                    sense of duty separated from their <lb/>friends and relatives. Many of the
                    Indians came to <lb/>see us this afternoon and took us by the hand with
                    <lb/>evident tokens of great joy, which is a clear indica-<lb/> tion that they
                    are highly pleased with, and in good <lb/>measure sensible of our disinterested
                    endeavor to <lb/>improve them in agriculture, mechanical arts, and
                    <lb/>profitable civilization. We observed, as we sailed <lb/>down, the Indian
                    reserve of land along the river to <lb/>be excellent; and when we came within
                    fourteen or <lb/>fifteen miles of <placeName ref="genes1"
                        >Genesinguhta</placeName>, the settlements and<lb/>
                    <pb n="563" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_23"/> improvements began to appears, and many
                    of the In-<lb/>dians have begun to clear out and cultivate their <lb/>ground;
                    have built houses more comfortable than<lb/>they were formerly accustomed to.
                    When I was up <lb/>the river from this place four years ago, I believe
                    <lb/>there were but three or four settlements worth <lb/>noticing; and now there
                    are eighteen or nineteen, <lb/>and divers of them have large fields of corn,
                    con-<lb/>siderable stock of cattle, and some of them this sea-<lb/>son had wheat
                    for sale; so that upon the whole I <lb/> think they have improved in agriculture
                    beyond my <lb/>expectations. Soon after we arrived, our friends <lb/>showed us
                    the copy of a speech made by <persName ref="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>
                    <lb/> and his brother, <persName ref="conud1">Conudiu</persName>, on the
                    proposal of their <lb/>moving off the Indians' land and settling near them
                    <lb/>where they might have the opportunity of being in-<lb/>structed as usual
                    and building a saw-mill, which is as <lb/>follows:</p></div><div type="speech">
                <p> "<persName ref="conud1">Conudiu</persName> first spoke: It is now a long time
                    since <lb/>you came to live amongst us; it have even exceeded <lb/>the limits
                    that were first proposed. I now speak the <lb/>united voice of our cheifs and
                    warriors to you, our <lb/> women also, and all our people. Attend, therefore,
                    <lb/>to what I say. We wish you to make your minds <lb/>perfectly easy; we are
                    all pleased with your living <lb/>amongst us, and not one of us wants you to
                    leave our <lb/> country. We find no fault with you in any respect <lb/>since you
                    came among us, neither have we anything <lb/>to charge you with. You have lived
                    peaceably and <lb/>honestly with us, and have been preserved in health,<lb/>and
                    nothing has befallen you. This we think is proof <lb/>that the Great Spirit also
                    is pleased with your living <lb/>here and with what you have done for us.</p>
                <p> "Friends, Tewenstee, we have been very much en-<lb/>gaged in business respecting
                    the affairs of our na-<lb/>tion, which has prevented us from answering you
                    <lb/>proposals of declining the settlement at <placeName ref="genes1"
                        >Genesinguhta</placeName>
                    <lb/>and moving up the river to settle on land of your <lb/> own joining ours.
                    We now all agree to leave you at <lb/>full liberty either to remain where you
                    now are on our <lb/>land, or to move up the river and settle, on land of
                    <lb/>you own--only that you settle near us. The <geogName ref="lvall">Little
                        <lb/>Valley</geogName> is as far up the river as our people are willing
                    <lb/>you should go, as we want you to be near us, that you <lb/> may extend
                    further assistance and instruction; for <lb/>although we have experienced much
                    benefit from <lb/>you, and some of our people have made considerable
                    <lb/>advancement in the knowledge of useful labor, yet <lb/>we remain very
                    deficient in many things, num-<lb/>bers of us are yet poor.</p>
                <p> Friends, Tewenstee, I myself have been advising <lb/>our people to pursue the
                    course of life you recom-<lb/>mend to us, and we have fully concluded to follow
                    <lb/>habits of industry; but we are only just beginning to <lb/>learn, and we
                    find ourselves at a loss for tools to work <lb/>with. We now request you to
                    bring on plenty of <lb/>all kinds you think will be useful; then such of our
                    <lb/>people as are able will buy for themselves, and such <lb/>as are poor we
                    wish you to continue to lend to, and <lb/>they shall be returned to you again.
                    We also want <lb/>you to bring useful cloths and sell to us, that we may
                    <lb/>get some necessary things without having to go so far <lb/>for them. In
                    looking forward we can limit no time <lb/>for you to live beside us; this must
                    depend on your <lb/>own judgment. When your friends come from <placeName
                        key="phila">Phil-<lb/>adelphia</placeName> we wish you to communicate this
                    speech to <lb/>them as the full result of our minds concerning you."</p></div><div type="narrative">
                <p> After the foregoing speech was delivered <persName ref="cornp2"
                    >Corn-<lb/>planter</persName> spoke as follows:</p></div><div type="speech">
                <p> "Friends, Tewenstee, attend. I will add a little <lb/>further. When I was in
                        <placeName ref="phila">Phildelphia</placeName>, a long time <lb/>ago, the
                    Indians and white people at that time con-<lb/>tinued to kill each other; I then
                    heard of Quakers, <lb/> that they were a peaceable people, and would not
                    <lb/>fight or kill anybody. I inquired of the President <lb/>of the United
                    States about them, whether or not this <lb/>account was true. He said it was
                    true enough; they <lb/> were such a people. I then requested him to send
                    <lb/>some of them to live amonst the Indians, expecting <lb/>they would be very
                    useful to us. Then it was a long <lb/>time after before you came. You are now
                    here, and <lb/> it has afforded me much satisfaction that you have <lb/>come. I
                    have not been disappointed in the account <lb/>I heard of you. You have lived
                    peacefully among us, <lb/>and no difficulty has happened between you and our
                    <lb/>people. We now want you to stay with us and stand <lb/>between us and the
                    white people; and if you see any <lb/>of them trying to cheat us let us know of
                    it; or if you <lb/>see any of our people trying to cheat the white we <lb/>wish
                    you to let it be known also, as we confide in you<lb/>that you will not cheat
                    us.</p>
                <p> "Friends, we have now spoken so full on the busi-<lb/>ness that we need not say
                    any more until we find one <lb/>of you has killed one of our people, and we find
                    him <lb/>lying dead on the ground, or until one of us kills one <lb/>of you;
                    then we will take up the business again." [De-<lb/> livered the <date

                <p> Notwishstanding this, we thought it necessary to <lb/>see the chiefs and others
                    in council; and being in-<lb/>formed that <persName ref="cornp2"
                        >Cornplanter</persName> was just set out on a hunt-<lb/>ing tour, we hired
                    an Indian to go in the night, (though <lb/>it was a wet one), in quest of him.
                    He set out and <lb/> traversed the woods, blowing his horn; and just at
                    <lb/>daybreak found him, who came to us early this morn-<lb/>ing which is the
                        <date when="1803-09-21">21st</date>, and 4th of the week. After
                    <lb/>conferring with him, he appeared very much pleased <lb/>with our coming,
                    and agreed to send out for the dis-<lb/>tant chiefs and others to meet us in
                    council at this <lb/>place next Seventh- day morning. We then set off up<lb/>the
                    river in order to look for a suitable place to maek <lb/>a settlement and build
                    a saw-mill. Having viewed <lb/>two valleys heretofore had in view, but found the
                    <lb/> streams entirely dried up, we came to a fine stream <lb/>on the east side
                    of the river, called <geogName ref="tunes">Tunesasau</geogName>, on <lb/>which
                    we think there is a good mill-seat, being about <lb/>three and a half miles from
                    this place, and land tol-<lb/>erably good; then returned. On our way we had the
                    <lb/>curiosity to ascend a very high mountain in order to <lb/>have a prospect
                    of the river and adjacent country. <lb/><persName ref="jtayl1">Jacob
                        Taylor</persName> and myself pursued our <lb/>route until we got a grand
                    prospect of the river and <lb/>the adjacent country and a number of the Indian
                    set-<lb/>tlements, and got home as soon as the others. The <lb/>young Indian who
                    is the smith at <placeName ref="genes1">Genesinguhta</placeName>,<lb/>whose name
                    is <persName ref="lhalf1">Levi Halftown</persName>, went with us and re-<lb/>
                    <pb n="564" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_24"/> turned with those who gave out; he made
                    himself <lb/>very merry with us when walking through the woods; <lb/>said the
                    Quakers were like little children learning to <lb/>walk, and that we might now
                    see some of the hard-<lb/>ships the Indians had to pass through in their
                    hunt-<lb/>ing, only that it would not dor for them to stop and <lb/>rest; but
                    when he found I went on, said there was <lb/>one hardy man amongst them. I think
                    I never heard <lb/>
                    <persName ref="tstew1">Thomas Stewardson</persName> complain or give out until
                    this <lb/>time. In the evening <persName ref="eblue1">Blue Eyes</persName> came;
                    was very <lb/>glad to see us, but was sorry he had to go to <placeName
                        key="catta1">Catta-<lb/>raugus</placeName> to see a sick daughter, so that
                    he could not be <lb/>at the council. Because he is a steady friend and pro-<lb/>
                    moter of our concern for the good of the natives, be-<lb/>ng a chief who both by
                    precept and example endeav-<lb/>ors to lead them on in habits of sobriety and
                    indus-<lb/>try, and as he could not stay with us, we took the op-<lb/>ortunity
                    of opening to him some of the reasons of <lb/>our coming here at this time,
                    which was a proposal <lb/>of our young men's moving off their land and
                    set-<lb/>tling near them on some of their own. He was wise <lb/>enough to see
                    the reason of the proposal; and al-<lb/>though he saw and gave in to the
                    propriety of it, yet <lb/>appeared sorry, and he is a near neighbor; and said if
                    <lb/>they moved he would wait to see how they would do <lb/>and then move near
                    them. Truly the opportunity <lb/>this evening with <persName ref="eblue1">Blue
                        Eyes</persName> had a tendency to pro-<lb/>duce some very pleasant
                    sensations in my mind, and <lb/>I thought I could own him for, and really felt
                    him <lb/>near, as a brother.</p>

                    <date when="1803-09-22">22<emph rend="italics">d</emph>.</date> Fifth of the
                    week. This being the day on <lb/>which the young men hold their meeting, we sat
                    with <lb/>them, which I believe was a time of refreshment to <lb/>us all. In the
                    afternoon walked about viewing the <lb/> improvements the Indians ahve made
                    which are con-<lb/>siderable. Several of them have a good deal of corn, <lb/>and
                    some have raised some wheat; but I think they <lb/>have not improved in
                    agriculture and industry equal <lb/>to those up the river. We saw two of them
                    threshing<lb/>their wheat; but as they had not barn to put it in, it
                    <lb/>appeared to be somewhat damaged in the stack. I <lb/>endeavored to put them
                    upon building barns, which <lb/>they promised to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <date when="1803-09-23">23<emph rend="italics">d</emph>.</date> We all in
                    company with <persName ref="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName>, <persName
                        key="jpenn1">John <lb/>Pennock</persName> and <persName ref="jswai1">Joel
                        Swayne</persName>, went down to <placeName ref="genes1"
                        >Genesing-<lb/>uhta</placeName>, or Cornplanter's Village, nine and a half
                    miles. <lb/>Being eight of us having three horses, <persName ref="jtayl1">Jacob
                        Taylor</persName>
                    <lb/>and myself walked all the way and back again, being <lb/> nineteen miles.
                    The others rode turn about. We ar-<lb/>rived at the village about eleven o'clock
                    and spent <lb/>two or three hours in viewing the Indians' houses,
                    <lb/>corn-fields, and other improvements; and although <lb/> we discovered
                    fourteen shingled houses and abund-<lb/>ance of corn, yet I think they have not
                    improved <lb/>four years past, equal to the Indians up the river. We <lb/>dined
                    at <persName ref="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>'s upon the best venison I have
                    <lb/>eaten since I left home, Indian bread, butter, butter-<lb/>milk, bears' fat
                    and squashes. Some of our company <lb/>were very desirous to return before
                    dinner; but <persName ref="jtayl1">Jacob <lb/>Taylor</persName> told them it
                    would not do. They then sum-<lb/>moned all the fortitude they could and sat down
                    to <lb/>dinner. <persName ref="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName>, <persName
                        key="jpenn1">John Pennock</persName>, <persName ref="jswai1">Joel

                    and myself at with good-will; <lb/>the others did as well as they could. The old
                    chief <lb/>was very pleasant with us and made himself very <lb/>cheerful,
                    inquiring for <persName ref="hsimm1">Henry Simmons</persName>; said he was <lb/>
                    a man for his mind, and if he had not been a Quaker <lb/>he would have made a
                    very good war chief. Some <lb/>time after dinner, we returned. <persName
                        key="jtayl1">J. Taylor</persName>, <persName ref="tstew1">Thomas
                        <lb/>Stewardson</persName>, <persName ref="ibons1">Isaac Bonsal</persName>,
                        <persName ref="gvaux1">George Vaux</persName> and myself <lb/>walked one or
                    two miles near the river bank; the <lb/>other three rode. On our way passed
                    through abun-<lb/>dance of good corn and beans, and by eight or ten <lb/>
                    houses, some of them very complete work, with stone <lb/>chimneys. In one of
                    them lives an old woman, half-<lb/>sister of <persName ref="cornp2"
                        >Cornplanter</persName>, with three or four sons. The <lb/>poor old woman
                    was rejoiced to see us; said she was <lb/>thankful to the Good Spirit for
                    preserving us in our <lb/>long journey to see them, and also that He put it in
                    <lb/>our hearts to have compassion on them; and that she<lb/>was old and did not
                    expect to be at the council to-<lb/>morrow, but hoped the Good Spirit would
                    preserve <lb/>us. Truly the manner of her expression, the tears <lb/>standing in
                    her eyes, and the whole of her deport-<lb/>ment, expression, and appearance had
                    a tendency to <lb/>enliven the affectionate feelings of my heart, and I
                    <lb/>could not help thinking she was as much the favorite <lb/> of Him who sees
                    not as man sees, as many who think <lb/>themselves more polished. In about three
                    miles' <lb/>walking, <persName ref="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>, <persName
                        key="conud1">Conudiu</persName>, and about twenty or <lb/> thirty more of
                    the Indians overtook us on their way <lb/>up to the council. I walked very
                    pleasantly and cheer-<lb/>fully with them. The old chief, Cornplanter, wanted
                    <lb/>me to ride his horse; but when I refused, he said I <lb/>was a sachem.</p>

                <p>"Brothers, since we came here we have been<lb/>viewing the land, and think if the
                        <orgName key="hollco">Holland Company</orgName><lb/>will sell us a piece on <geogName
                        key="tunec">Tunesasah Creek</geogName> that it will be<lb/>a suitable place
                    for our friends to settle upon; they<lb/>will then still be among your
                    settlements.</p>
                <p>"Brothers, when our friends first came to settle<lb/>among you, we told you the
                    tools they then brought<lb/>should be for your use, to be lent among such of
                        you<lb/><pb n="578" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_26"/>as wanted to use them. They
                    have been so lent,<lb/>and we have sent others for our friends to use.<lb/> When
                    our friends remove, such of the first parcel of<lb/>tools as remain with them,
                    will be left with your<lb/>chiefs to be lent out for the good of the nation.</p>
                <p>"Brothers, we have lent some blacksmith tools to<lb/>the smith who resides at the
                    upper town; the others<lb/>our friends take with them; but the smith who
                    lives<lb/>here may have the use of them. The two smiths we<lb/>hope are now able
                    to do nearly all the smith-work<lb/>you will want.</p>
                <p>"Brothers, if our friends get a house put up before<lb/>winter suitable for their
                    accommmodation, they will<lb/>remove from the one they now live in. The
                    barn<lb/>and some of the land they may want another sum-<lb/>mer, as perhaps
                    they cannot get land enough cleared<lb/>to raise grain and hay for their cattle.
                    You will<lb/>agree among yourselves which of you shall live here<lb/>when our
                    friends remove.</p>
                <p>"Brothers, when our friends remove they will<lb/>continue to give you assistance
                    and instruction when<lb/>they can; if they think you stand in need of
                    it.<lb/>Several of you have tools, and as there are some of<lb/>the first parcel
                    which came up that are not worn out,<lb/>they will be left with the chiefs to be
                    lent to such as<lb/>want. Many of these tools are already lent; we<lb/>think it
                    will be best for you to appoint some person<lb/>to have particular charge and
                    care of them, as lend-<lb/>ing tools has been very troublesome.</p>
                <p>"Brothers, we understand by your speech to our<lb/>friends that you want them to
                    bring on tools and<lb/>cloth to sell. Brothers, we do not want them to
                    keep<lb/>a store of goods among you; we think it will not be<lb/>best; but we
                    intend to send on a few scythes, sickles,<lb/>augers, and some such tools for
                    our friends to sell to<lb/>such of you as may want to buy; but if any of
                    your<lb/>people buy from them and then sell to the white<lb/>people, they are
                    not to sell any more to such as do so.</p>
                <p>"Brothers, we again repeat it, we wish you to<lb/>speak your minds freely to us,
                    and if there is any-<lb/>thing which you and we do not understand
                    alike,<lb/>that you will tell us, as it is our wish to comply with<lb/>all our
                    engagements. The iron which our friends<lb/>have promised you will be sent on as
                    soon as the<lb/>water will admit."</p></div><div type="narrative">
                <p>After a little pause, <persName ref="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> replied: "If
                    you<lb/>will leave us a little while, we will counsel among<lb/>ourselves and
                    return you an answer."</p>
                <p>We then left them about an hour, when they sent<lb/>us word they were ready. We
                    again seated ourselves<lb/>as before, when Cornplanter addressed us in
                    sub-<lb/>stance as follows:</p></div><div type="speech">
                <p>"We are all glad to see you that are now assem-<lb/>bled in council, and glad to
                    hear what you say to us;<lb/>and your speech is good, being the same
                    language<lb/>you have always spoken to us. We know the time is<lb/>out that was
                    first agreed upon for your young men to<lb/>stay with us, and that nothing had
                    been said to us<lb/>about their staying longer, and perhaps that was
                    the<lb/>reason why they wanted to purchase a piece of land<lb/>from the
                        <orgName>Holland Company</orgName> joining to ours; but they<lb/>were
                    welcome to live where they now do as long as<lb/>they please; and if the
                        <orgName>Holland Company</orgName> will not<lb/>sell you any land, we hope
                    they will continue to live<lb/>where they now do. When your friends first
                    came,<lb/>and for a long time after, many of the white people<lb/>told us to
                    'watch the Quakers well, for they are a<lb/>cunning, designing people, [and]
                    under pretense of<lb/>doing something for you intend to get some advan-<lb/>tage
                    of you some way or other.' But of late, finding<lb/>all was straight and no
                    advantage attempted to be<lb/>taken, they have left off talking about it.
                    Your<lb/>young men and we have now lived several years as<lb/>brothers. When
                    they came here we were very ig-<lb/>norant, but are now just beginning to learn.
                    Your<lb/>young men do not talk much to us, but when they<lb/>do they speak good
                    words and have been very help-<lb/>ful in keeping us from using whiskey. We had
                    de-<lb/>sired them to agree among themselves who should<lb/>live in this house,
                    as your young men expect to leave<lb/>it before winter; but we do not think it
                    right to fix<lb/>on any one yet, for if you cannot buy a piece of land,<lb/>they
                    will need this place themselves; and if you do<lb/>buy a piece, they may not get
                    a house fit to live in<lb/>before winter, and then they will want it
                    themselves.<lb/>You have said you will leave all the buildings,
                    fences,<lb/>farm, etc., for us to have, except the barn and some<lb/>of the land
                    next summer to raise some grain and<lb/>hay for yourselves and cattle until you
                    can raise it<lb/>on your new settlement; but it is hard work to cut<lb/>down so
                    many big trees and clear the land; perhaps<lb/>they cannot get enough cleared
                    next summer, and if<lb/>they do not, they are welcome to work this as
                    long<lb/>as they need it. So it will be time enough to choose<lb/>one of our
                    people to have this house and farm when<lb/>your young men are well fixed on the
                    new place.<lb/>We will appoint some of our chiefs to receive the<lb/>tools and
                    collect such as are lent out; to have the<lb/>charge of lending them. In our
                    speech to your young<lb/>men we requested them to bring cloth and tools
                    to<lb/>sell to us that we might not be cheated by the white<lb/>people. But you
                    have come to a wise conclusion in<lb/>not keeping a general store amongst us,
                    for perhaps<lb/>some uneasiness or dispute might arise if a store were<lb/>kept.
                    But we thank you for your kind intention of<lb/>bringing some scythes, sickles,
                    augers, etc., to sell to<lb/>such of our people as may want them, and are
                    pleased<lb/>that such who buy are restricted from selling to white<lb/>people;
                    also for the iron which you propose to give<lb/>to us, we wish your young men
                    may divide amongst<lb/>our people, and then we can get the smiths to
                    make<lb/>such things as we want.</p>
                <p>"Brothers, we are well pleased with your conduct<lb/>toward us and having always
                    done what you prom-<lb/>ised to do."</p></div><div type="narrative">
                <p>An old chief called <persName ref="mush1">Mush</persName>said a few words as
                    a<lb/>kind of acknowledgment for some little uneasiness<lb/>he had occasioned
                    principally by his not heretofore<lb/>understanding the nature of our intention
                    or prospect<lb/>of settling our young men amongst them, but now<lb/>appeared
                    perfectly satisfied. Then <persName ref="conne1">Connewauteu</persName><lb/>said
                    that we promised to endeavor to send a smith<lb/>among them; that after some
                    time we did send one,<lb/>but he stayed a short time, "and our smiths
                    were<lb/>not fully perfect in the trade. Now you have sent a<lb/>smith, the best
                    we ever saw; he can make every-<lb/>thing we want, but he has been here but a
                    very little<lb/>time and now says he is going away. We wish he<lb/>
                    <pb n="579" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_27"/>would stay all winter, and then we think
                    our smiths<lb/>by that time, with his instruction, will be able to do<lb/>our
                    work; but now they cannot do all we want."</p>
                <p>We replied that <persName ref="jpenn1">John Pennock,</persName> (the good
                    smith<lb/>he meant), had a wife and children at home who re-<lb/>quired his
                    attention, and we could not urge him to<lb/>stay from them longer than he was
                    willing; that he<lb/>had been with them as long as we expected; but<lb/>when we
                    got home we would mention their request<lb/>to our friends for them to consider
                    whether they<lb/>could help them or not.</p>
                <p>And as I have heretofore and more stongly of<lb/>late felt my mind impressed with
                    strong desires for<lb/>the benefit and improvement of the poor natives
                    from<lb/>whom our predecessors in the first settlement of<lb/><placeName
                        key="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName> received so much kindness and
                    assist-<lb/>ance, at times [I] felt a flow of good-will towards<lb/>them, and
                    the rest of my brethren present having<lb/>desired me to reply to them, I
                    addressed them in sub-<lb/>stance, as follows:</p></div><div type="speech">
                <p>"Brethren and friends attend. It is now a great<lb/>many years since our
                    forefathers, the Quakers, came<lb/> over the great water and began to settle in
                    that part<lb/>of this country called <placeName ref="penns"
                        >Pennsylvania.</placeName> At that time<lb/>the Indians were very numerous
                    and we were but<lb/>very few. The Indians were kind to our
                    forefathers,<lb/>helped and assisted them in the wilderness. Love<lb/>and
                    confidence were kept alive towards our fathers<lb/>and the Indians a great many
                    years, and they were<lb/>at peace with each other; but after some years a
                    great<lb/>many other people came over the great water and a<lb/>great many were
                    born here who were not so peace-<lb/>able and did not love the Indians so much
                    as our<lb/>fathers did, who were the first settlers. And as these<lb/>people
                    became numerous, for a good while [they] had<lb/>a share in the great councils
                    in <placeName ref="penns">Pennsylvania;</placeName> and at<lb/>length as our
                    fathers, the Quakers, were altogether<lb/>for peace, and the others became the
                    more numerous,<lb/>they took the great councils of the State affairs
                        in<lb/><placeName ref="penns">Pennsylvania</placeName> into their hands;
                    many of these were<lb/>very desirous of having the Indians' lands, and
                    as<lb/>fast as they could kept driving them back. Then In-<lb/>dians began to
                    kill white men and white men to kill<lb/>Indians. All this time the Quakers
                    loved the In-<lb/>dians and did not kill any of them, but were very<lb/>sorry
                    the Indians and white men did kill one another,<lb/>but could not help it; and
                    [during] the long time of<lb/>Indians and white men being at war and killing
                    one<lb/>another, treaties were often appointed, and although<lb/>the Quakers had
                    no power over either the Indians or<lb/>whites, yet some of them almost always
                    attended the<lb/>treaties to try to keep the Indians from being cheated<lb/>out
                    of their land or other things. The wars and<lb/>troubles continued at times
                    between the Indians and<lb/>whites, until about ten years ago when there
                    seemed<lb/>to be a general peace agreed upon between the In-<lb/>dians and white
                    people in this country. Soon after<lb/>that, at one of our great councils in
                    Philadelphia,<lb/>where there were a great many hundred Quakers<lb/>present, we
                    remembered our Indian brothers, whose<lb/>fathers were so kind to our fathers,
                    and on whose<lb/>fathers' lands, (which once belonged to them), we<lb/>now live
                    so comfortably; and our Indian brothers<lb/>being driven back, we counciled
                    amongst ourselves<lb/>to know what way we could do them the most good.<lb/>We
                    then thought if we would raise a great deal of<lb/>money--and give it to them,
                    they would soon waste<lb/>it and spend it for whiskey and in other ways
                    which<lb/>would do them no good at last. Then we concluded<lb/>to ask leave of
                    the President of the United States to<lb/>try to help our Indian brothers. The
                    President ap-<lb/>peared to love the Indians and gave us leave; and as<lb/>we
                    knew that by clearing and cultivating our land we<lb/>had got to live
                    comfortably, we thought it would be<lb/>best to get some of our sober,
                    industrious young men<lb/>to come out and live amongst them and endeavor
                    to<lb/>teach them to clear and farm their land so that they<lb/>might live
                    comfortably as we do on ours. It is now<lb/>several years since some of our
                    young men have been<lb/>living amongst you.</p>
                <p>"Now, brothers, it rejoices our hearts to find that<lb/>the Good Spirit has
                    preserved our young men<lb/>amongst you and that we see signs of industry
                    taking<lb/>place; many of you are beginning to build better<lb/>houses and clear
                    out your land, raise more corn, as<lb/>well as cattle and wheat, particularly up
                    the river.<lb/>Brothers, you may be assured that we do not want<lb/>anything
                    from you for all that we do for you, neither<lb/>your skins, your furs, your
                    land, nor anything else<lb/>that you have; only that you should attend to
                    the<lb/>counsel and instruction of our young men who live<lb/>among you.
                    Brothers, it made our hearts glad when<lb/>we heard from our young men that the
                        <orgName key="seneca">Seneca nation</orgName><lb/>of
                    Indians, more especially on the <geogName ref="alleg">Alleghany
                    River</geogName>,<lb/>had taken up the resolution to banish whiskey
                    and<lb/>other strong liquor from amongst you; we wish you<lb/>to be strong in
                    your resolution and join together as<lb/>one man against this mighty evil; and
                    when any of<lb/>your young men are out hunting or otherwise met<lb/>with white
                    people that offer it to them, be sure to re-<lb/>fuse, for when a man drinks
                    some he mostly wants<lb/>more and more until he gets drunk; and when that<lb/>is
                    the case either with white people or Indians, they<lb/>mostly neglect their
                    business; their wives and chil-<lb/>dren often suffer for want of necessary
                    things.<lb/>Brothers, there are other things that do a great many<lb/>white men
                    much harm, which are gaming, playing<lb/>cards and laying wagers; whereby many
                    of them<lb/>not only spend their time unprofitably, but often lose<lb/>almost
                    all that their wives, children, and themselves<lb/>should have to live upon. We
                    wish you not to fall<lb/>into any of these practices, but to live sober,
                    indus-<lb/>trious lives; and then the Good Spirit will love and<lb/>preserve
                    you. But if you will get drunk and be<lb/>wicked, you will feel sorrow and
                    trouble in your own<lb/>hearts for it."</p></div><div type="narrative">

                    we<lb/>had given them a large sum of money it would all<lb/>have been gone
                    before now and they would have<lb/>been none the better; and he appeared quite
                    elevated<lb/>with <persName ref="jparr1">John Parrish's</persName> prospect of
                    their having domestic<lb/>animals instead of the wild, and said very
                    pleasantly<lb/><pb n="580" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_28"/>that he should soon be an old man leaning on
                    his<lb/>staff and could no more go out to hunt, and if they<lb/>followed our
                    advice he would then never want fresh<lb/>meat--he could have it at the door and
                    not have to<lb/>go to the woods for it. Then the chiefs and divers of<lb/>the
                    young men took us by the hand and with great<lb/>marks of affection concluded
                    the council.</p>

                    appeared somewhat delicate as to food<lb/>and lodging, I find almost any person

                    effect:</p>
                <p>"Brothers, we believe it was consistent with the<lb/>mind of the Great Spirit,
                    that we should meet here<lb/>to-day. We thank the Great Spirit for
                    preserving<lb/>you in your long journey to see us; and it is quite<lb/>plain to
                    us that he intends to do us good, because he<lb/>has put it into the hearts of
                    the Quakers to come and<lb/>see us, and to instruct us; and now you are
                    come,<lb/>have found us, (and we have met you), all in good<lb/>health, our
                    hearts are so filled with thanks to the<lb/>Great Spirit above, and to you, that
                    we can not ex-<lb/>press it."</p>

                <p>"Brothers, we are thankful to the Great Spirit for<lb/>opening the way for us to
                    meet here to-day. Our<lb/>hearts are made glad when we remember the
                    Great<lb/>Spirit has put it into the hearts of our brothers to<lb/>take notice
                    of us; for we are a poor, destitute people,<lb/>our lands being almost all gone,
                    and we hope you will<lb/>excuse, or not think hard of us, when we open our<lb/>
                    helpless situation to you. We have sent for <persName ref="jtayl1"
                        >Jacob<lb/>Taylor</persName> to give us some advice about our saw-mill,
                    it<lb/>being out of order. Now we are convinced the Good<lb/>Spirit approves of
                    our request, and has a mind to do<lb/>us good, because he has so ordered it that
                    our<lb/>brothers, some of the Quaker chiefs, have come along<lb/>with him.</p>
                <p>"Brothers, we have been made glad when we<lb/>heard from our brothers, the
                    Quakers, that they were<lb/> willing to take three or four of our boys and
                    instruct<lb/>them in farming and other useful training and occu-<lb/>pations.
                    Brothers, we are very thankful to you for<lb/>your kind offer, and we have been
                    counselling among<lb/>ourselves and trying to get some boys about the age<lb/>of
                    fifteen, that will be of good dispositions and in-<lb/>genious in learning; for
                    we think if we could get<lb/>some of them instructed as you are, they might
                    be<lb/>very useful to our nation, not only in teaching others,<lb/>but in
                    keeping our accounts, so that we may not be<lb/>cheated. Brothers, we find this
                    is a very hard thing<lb/> to come at. We have a good many boys that
                    would<lb/>do, but their relations think so much of them they<lb/> cannot bear to
                    part with them; but here is one, a<lb/>nephew of mine, fifteen years old, who is
                    willing to<lb/> go, and is a fine boy. His father and mother are<lb/>also
                    willing; but his grandfather and his uncle refuse<lb/> to let him go, and say
                    they cannot part with him, so<lb/>we must give him out for the present, for it
                    is of the<lb/> utmost importance to us to maintain harmony in our<lb/>nation.
                    There is one about nine years old that I<lb/> would be glad you would take; he
                    is a fine boy."</p></div><div type="narrative">
                <p>Then the chief warrior, <persName ref="wauun1"
                    >Wau-un-de-guh-ta</persName>,ad-<lb/>dressed us; although they were not in a
                    very florid<lb/>style, yet his remarks appeared, and we fully believed<lb/>them,
                    to be the product of an honest and sincere<lb/>heart; to this effect:</p></div><div type="speech">
                <p>"Brothers, I hope you will not think hard of us<lb/>when we open our hearts to
                    you, for we are a poor,<lb/> destitute people, and our land is now so nearly
                    all<lb/>sold that we have but a little left for every family;<lb/> and the deer
                    is become very scarce, so that we often<lb/>may hunt all day and have nothing at
                    night. Broth-<lb/> ers, our hearts rejoiced when we heard the Quakers<lb/>were
                    taking pity on us, although we could scarcely<lb/> think there was any people
                    who would do so much<lb/>as you are doing for us, without being paid. But<lb/>
                    now we are convinced that the Quakers have the<lb/>good of our nation at heart,
                    for we see you have sent<lb/> some of your young men to the <geogName
                        key="alleg">Allegheny River</geogName> to<lb/>teach the Indians to farm,
                    without asking any pay<lb/>for it; and we see that many of our people
                    are<lb/>learning. They live much better than formerly, and<lb/>we have seen so
                    much of the conduct of your young<lb/>men that we can rely upon them; and we
                    have found<lb/><persName ref="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName> to be a true man.
                    Brothers, we are<lb/> ashamed to ask what we are now going to ask of you,<lb/>
                    but our necessity makes us willing. We cannot ex-<lb/> pect you to do so much as
                    to send any of your young<lb/>men to live among us; but we think if you
                    would<lb/> send us a set of smith's tools, we have a young man<lb/>that has
                    learned at <placeName ref="genes1">Genesinguhta,</placeName> that can do
                    our<lb/> smith work. Now we have to go above thirty miles<lb/>to get it done and
                    often have to wait near a week be-<lb/>fore we can get it done. And we are
                    determined to<lb/>get to farming, working our land, and to raising wheat<lb/>to
                    support our families. Brothers, you have done a<lb/> great deal for us in
                    sending us saw-mill irons which<lb/>have been of great use to us; but our
                    saw-mill is out<lb/>of order, and that is the reason we sent for <persName
                        key="jtayl1">Jacob<lb/> Taylor</persName> to show us how to mend it, as he
                    is a man we<lb/>can confide in. But, brothers, do not think hard of<lb/>us if we
                    should ask one thing more, for the Great<lb/>Spirit has blessed you with wise
                    hearts and you are<lb/>become rich; and that is we have but one plow
                    and<lb/>many of us are desirous of becoming farmers and<lb/>sow wheat, but
                    cannot get a plow. If you would send<lb/>us another set of plow-irons, we have
                    two good yoke<lb/>of oxen and a number of horses, then we think we<lb/> could do
                    pretty well. </p>
                <p>"Brothers, we have heard your advice or counsel<lb/>to us in time past to refrain
                    from drinking whiskey.<lb/>We thank you for it, for we see if we do not, we
                    shall<lb/> come to nothing; and, brothers, you sent us a letter<lb/>four years
                    ago wherein you told us that if we did not <lb/>leave off drinking whiskey you
                    would be discouraged<lb/>from trying to help us, but if we would leave off
                    and<lb/>become sober men, you would be encouraged to as-<lb/>sist us as you
                    could. That letter we have yet. [They<lb/>then produced the letter to us and we
                    found it was<lb/>written by <persName ref="tstew1">Thos. Stewardson</persName>
                    and myself, and our<lb/> names were signed to it]. Now, brothers, we
                    are<lb/>often counselling together about it, and are determ-<lb/>ined to refrain
                    from the use of it, and although some<lb/>few of our young men sometimes break
                    over our res-<lb/>olution, we think we are gaining ground or strength<lb/>in the
                    good undertaking; and of all the chiefs and<lb/>warriors that are now present,
                    we believe not one has<lb/>been drunk for more than two years past, and
                    some<lb/>for a longer time than that, and divers of us have not<lb/> drunk any;
                    so we are encouraged to be strong in full<lb/>hope that we shall banish it
                    altogether."</p></div><div type="narrative">
                <p>In the evening the chief warrior's daughter, who<lb/>is an amiable young woman,
                    came home from a visit<lb/> at <placeName ref="buffa">Buffalo,</placeName>
                    accompanied by a young man her rela-<lb/>tion. On their way they discovered a
                    young deer<lb/>about half-grown, in the edge of <geogName ref="lakee">Lake
                        Erie,</geogName> which<lb/>they chased with their canoe and killed with
                    their<lb/>setting poles and brought it home. Some of the<lb/> meat added to the
                    satisfaction of our supper. After<lb/>their arrival, <persName ref="wauun1"
                        >Wau-un-de-guh-ta</persName> introduced his daugh-<lb/>ter to us all, one by
                    one, holding her by the hand;<lb/>and she without any appearance of unbecoming
                    shy-<lb/>ness shook hands with us all, in a modest manner,<lb/>which altogether
                    appeared so becomingly polite that<lb/>we could not help noticing it with
                    peculiar pleasure.<lb/>On taking leave of him in the morning, he in
                    a<lb/>weighty and feeling manner expressed: "We are<lb/>glad you have stayed two
                    nights with us, and I hope<lb/>the Great Spirit will look down upon you and
                    pre-<lb/>serve you in your long journey, and favor you with a<lb/>clear sky, so
                    that you may get home in good health<lb/> and find your wives and children
                    so."</p>
                <pb n="595" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_31"/>
                <p>We then withdrew a few minutes to confer upon<lb/>their proposals and requests,
                    and soon returned to in-<lb/> form them what we agreed upon. <persName
                        key="jshoe1">John Shoemaker</persName><lb/>rose and informed them<lb/> that
                    we believed it would not<lb/>be best to send one boy only, because he would be
                    likely<lb/>to feel himself lonesome and so become uneasy;<lb/>neither did we
                    think it would be best to send one<lb/>younger than 13 years, lest when the
                    older one had<lb/>served out his time and had gone home, the younger<lb/>one
                    would be uneasy. But if they could get two or<lb/>three boys of good disposition
                    and near of an age who<lb/> would be willing to come and work as some of
                    our<lb/>children do, we should be willing to accept of them<lb/> and use our
                    endeavours to instruct them.</p>
                <p>Then <persName ref="tstew1">Thomas Stewardson</persName>informed them
                    that<lb/>although we had not proposed to do any great matters<lb/>for them, yet
                    as they appeared desirous of improv-<lb/>ing, we were willing to assist them a
                    little, and would<lb/>send them a pair of bellows, an anvil, vise, and
                    some<lb/>other tools to begin with, if they thought <persName ref="sjemi1">Sam
                        Jemi-<lb/>son,</persName> (who has been instructed in the business
                        at<lb/><placeName ref="genes1">Genesinguhta</placeName>), would come and do
                    their work; also<lb/>we would furnish them with one hundred lbs. of iron,<lb/>a
                    set of plow-irons, and some steel to begin with.</p>
                <p><persName ref="wauun1">Wau-un-de-guh-ta</persName> then replied: "You are
                    wiser<lb/>than we, and we believe have come to a good conclu-<lb/>sion about the
                    boys, and we think we shall be likely<lb/>to get two pretty near of an age in a
                    few weeks, who<lb/>will be willing to go, and whose parents and rela-<lb/>tions
                    will consent to their going. And if any of our<lb/>boys are sent, we want them
                    taught to work as your<lb/>children are; for it will be of very little use for
                    them<lb/>just to learn to read and write if they do not know<lb/>how to
                    work.</p>
                <p>During almost all the time of the council, I think<lb/>that notwithstanding they
                    are a very dirty, mean<lb/>people in and about their houses, cookery, etc.,
                    I<lb/>never felt a greater flow of near affection to any<lb/>people, accompanied
                    with what I took to be an as-<lb/> surance that their souls are as precious in
                    the eyes of<lb/>Him who is impartial in judging of the inmost re-<lb/>cesses of
                    the heart, as ours are who have been blessed<lb/>with so many inexpressible
                    favours; (I fear too often<lb/>with but little sense of gratitude; to the
                    Great<lb/> Spirit for influencing our hearts to take pity on them,<lb/>and to us
                    in manifesting our kindness, insomuch that<lb/>I could not suppress a flow of
                    tears; and although a<lb/>good deal had been said on both sides, it being
                    likely<lb/>I should never have the same or a like opportunity,<lb/>I thought I
                    could not leave them easy without en-<lb/>deavoring to open to them the real
                    cause of our com-<lb/> ing; the origin of the concern which the Society
                    is<lb/>engaged in for their good; that the good men in our<lb/>Society always
                    loved our Indian brothers, and during<lb/>the whole time the white people and
                    Indians were at<lb/>war and killing one another, we had no hand in it
                    nor<lb/>could not be at war with anybody, but were sorry for<lb/>it. And
                    although we had no outward power in our<lb/>hands, generally when treaties were
                    appointed be-<lb/>tween the white people and themselves, some of us<lb/>attended
                    to try to keep them from being cheated.</p>
                <p>And when the war was over we were willing to try<lb/>to help and instruct them.
                    With much more similar<lb/>to what I expressed in the council at <placeName
                        key="genes1">Genesinguhta,</placeName><lb/> relative to the bad effects
                    attendant upon the use of<lb/>ardent spirits both upon white men and
                    Indians,<lb/> with a strong recommendation to them to endeavour<lb/>to avail
                    themselves in every respect of the opportu-<lb/> nity put into their power of
                    improving the little good<lb/>land they have left, and following the advice and
                    ex-<lb/> ample set and given them by our young men who re-<lb/>side with their
                    brother <orgName key="seneca">Senecas</orgName> on the
                        <geogName ref="alleg">Allegheny<lb/>River.</geogName> Also I informed them
                    that <persName ref="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName> in-<lb/>tended to stop on
                    his return from <placeName ref="buffa">Buffalo</placeName> and view<lb/>their
                    saw-mill. And although we were desirous of<lb/>getting forward this afternoon,
                    on our way to <geogName ref="buffc1">Buffalo<lb/>Creek,</geogName> and made
                    attempts to conclude the council,<lb/>they were so pleased with our company that
                    it<lb/>seemed too hard for them to part with us; and the<lb/>chief warrior said
                    he was sorry and ashamed they<lb/> were not in a capacity to entertain us
                    better, but if<lb/>we would be so kind as to stay another night with<lb/>them
                    they would do the best they could, and <persName ref="tecon1">Flying<lb/>
                        Arrow</persName> said he would bring as much corn as our<lb/>horses could
                    eat. For my part, I was not in a ca-<lb/>pacity to refuse their request and told
                    my companions<lb/>I would rather stay with them until the next morn-<lb/>ing. To
                    this they all consented and we informed<lb/>them so. They seemed much rejoiced;
                    the chief<lb/>warrior saying we had made the hearts of their<lb/>women and
                    children glad, and some more of them<lb/>would be glad to take us by the band.
                        <persName ref="tecon1">Flying Arrow</persName><lb/>soon sent us plenty of
                    corn, and his father cut corn<lb/>tops enough and brought to our horses. The
                    chief<lb/>warrior's wife exerted herself in doing all she could<lb/>for us.
                    After the council was concluded and the most of<lb/>the Indians gone, also
                    Harry, who was our interpreter,<lb/>I had a good deal of very friendly
                    conversation with<lb/><persName ref="wauun1">Wau-un-de-guh-ta</persName>, (our
                    landlord), <persName ref="jtayl1">Jacob Taylor</persName> in-<lb/>terpreting. I
                    soon found there were such impres-<lb/>sions made upon his mind that it has
                    opened a door<lb/>to a large scope of inquiry; and I believe many<lb/>things
                    appeared in a fresh or new light to him. I<lb/>discovered him for some time to
                    be in a deep study;<lb/>at last he said there was one thing he wanted to
                    ask<lb/>but was afraid the question would not please us. We<lb/> told him he
                    might ask anything. He then said,<lb/>some time ago when he was at the
                        <placeName ref="feder">Federal City,</placeName> on<lb/>his way there he saw
                    a great many black men that<lb/>were slaves to white men and looked miserable;
                    and<lb/>he wanted to know whether the Quakers kept any of<lb/>them. We told him
                    we did not, and did not think it<lb/>right. He seemed very much pleased. Many
                    things<lb/>more he asked; [so] that truly the undissembled ap-<lb/>pearace and
                    conduct of this man and his wife made<lb/>very pleasant impressions on all our
                    minds.</p>

                <p>EARLY in the morning on the <date when="1803-09-30">30th [of 9th
                        month,<lb/>1803]</date> we all set off and rode to <placeName ref="buffa"
                        >New Amsterdam,</placeName> at the<lb/> mouth of <geogName ref="buffc1"
                        >Buffalo Creek,</geogName>which is about thirty-three<lb/> miles, eight of
                    which is mostly bad road or path<lb/>through the woods to <geogName ref="lakee"
                        >Lake Erie;</geogName> the other part of<lb/>the way is down the lake on the
                    margin. A very<lb/>pleasant ride, although each time I have ridden it I<lb/>have
                    been affected with the headache. A material<lb/>change appears to me to have
                    taken place on the<lb/>margin since I was along it four years ago.
                    The<lb/>beautiful beds of lime-stone are generally covered<lb/>with sand, and
                    much of the best kind of slate very<lb/>much gone. When we arrived at <placeName
                        key="buffa">Amsterdam,</placeName>
                    <persName ref="redja1">Red<lb/>Jacket</persName>and several other Indian chiefs
                    were there<lb/>along with the mill-wrights who say they have com-<lb/>pleted the
                    saw-mill for the Indians and want their<lb/> pay. We sent for some of them and
                    desired to know<lb/>whether we could have them personally in council<lb/>
                    to-morrow at their village. <persName ref="redja1">Red Jacket</persName>
                    informed us<lb/>they would be glad if they could comply with our<lb/>desire, but
                    hoped we would have patience, for they<lb/>could not well meet us to-morrow, but
                    would meet<lb/>early the next day. We then conferred together and<lb/>
                    <persName ref="ibons1">Isaac Bonsal</persName> and <persName ref="gvaux1">George
                        Vaux</persName> were most easy to go<lb/>over the <geogName ref="niaga"
                        >Niagara river</geogName> to-morrow in order to be at<lb/> the meeting at

                    <persName ref="jshoe1">John Shoemaker,</persName> and myself were most<lb/>easy
                    to stay in order to attend the proposed council<lb/>on First-day morning.</p>
                <p><date when="1803-10-01"><emph rend="italics">Tenth month</emph>1<emph
                            rend="italics">st</emph></date>, and seventh of the week. <persName
                        key="jtayl1">Jacob<lb/>Taylor</persName> and myself went twelve miles up the
                        <geogName ref="buffc1">Buffalo<lb/>Creek</geogName> to see the new saw-mill
                    that is built for the<lb/>Indians, (we some time past having made them
                    a<lb/>present of all the iron), divers of the chiefs and one<lb/>
                    <pb n="611" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_33"/> of the undertakers attending. I discovered it to be<lb/>an
                    excellent seat, and it appeared to be a strong mill;<lb/> but upon trial in our
                    presence it was far from answer-<lb/>ing our expectations according to the
                    contract, by<lb/> not sawing half as fast as we believed such a stream-<lb/>head
                    and fall would do if the workmanship had been<lb/>effectually executed. The
                    chiefs said they were<lb/>ready to pay off the contract if we would say it
                    was<lb/>well done, according to contract; and on our confer-<lb/>ring with the
                    rest of our company the next day, we<lb/> advised them not to pay off the
                    contract until it was<lb/>completed. As I rode this twelve miles up the
                    creek<lb/> and back again through the Indian reserve I think a<lb/>great part of
                    it is equal if not superior to any piece<lb/> of land of equal quantity I ever
                    saw. I believe there<lb/>are more than a thousand acres upon which
                    there<lb/>might have been more than two tons of hay to the<lb/>acre mowed and
                    made the present year. </p>
                <p><date when="1803-10-02">2<emph rend="italics">d</emph></date>, and first of the
                    week. In the morning we set<lb/>off and arrived at the Indian village, in their
                    council<lb/>house, about eleven o'clock; but we had to wait until<lb/>near four
                    in the afternoon before what we thought a<lb/>competent number collected. They
                    generally appear<lb/>to be a more indolent, careless, and some of
                    them<lb/>intemperate people than those at <placeName ref="alleg1"
                        >Allegheny</placeName> and <placeName ref="catta1"
                        >Cat-<lb/>taraugus,</placeName> a few instances excepted, particularly

                    were<lb/> collected with some young men and women, we pro-<lb/>posed either
                    going back or opening the council. They<lb/>then went in the council house and
                    after sitting a<lb/>short space, <persName ref="tstew1">Thomas
                        Stewardson</persName> in a brief manner<lb/>informed them the reason of our
                    coming into their<lb/>settlement; and although there did not appear to be<lb/>
                    the same desire of improvement in many of the In-<lb/>dians in this settlement
                    as those we have been at be-<lb/>fore, which I believe is much owing to the
                    opportu-<lb/>nity they have of being corrupted by the example of<lb/>white
                    people at <placeName ref="buffa">New Amsterdam,</placeName> which is a very
                    dis-<lb/>sipated place, yet he felt encouraged to endeavor to<lb/>stimulate them
                    to industry and to refrain from spirit-<lb/>uous liquors. It was not a very
                    comfortable, animat-<lb/>ing time as yet with them, yet I was not easy to
                    omit<lb/>opening divers matters to their consideration in a<lb/>summary way,
                    which contained a good deal of the<lb/>heads of what I mentioned at the other
                    places; which<lb/>seemed to attract their attention. I also informed<lb/>them I
                    had seen a good deal of the land contained<lb/> in their reserve that is
                    excellent; and if they would<lb/>be industrious they might live well; but if
                    they would<lb/>not, but followed the practice of drinking, they would<lb/>lose
                    the little good land they now have, their wives<lb/>and children would have to
                    lie down under the snow<lb/>and go to sleep without anything to eat or to
                    keep<lb/>them warm. </p>
                <p><persName ref="jshoe1">John Shoemaker</persName> advised them to settle
                    farther<lb/> up the creek, where the land is so very good, and not<lb/>strive to
                    huddle together so close; which advice<lb/>seemed to please them very well.</p>
                <p><persName ref="redja1">Red Jacket</persName> then addressed us in a polite and
                    mas-<lb/> terly manner in which he displayed his talents as an<lb/>orator in a
                    methodical and flowery style near half an<lb/>hour. He took in every part of the
                    advice commu-<lb/>nicated to them by us, in regular order, and para-<lb/>phrased
                    upon it, with the frequent expression of<lb/>thanks to the Quakers, recounting
                    their kindness to<lb/>the Indian from the first settlement of <placeName
                        key="penns">Pennsylvania;</placeName><lb/>and concluded with endeavoring to
                    assure us if we<lb/>would come and see them two years hence, we should<lb/>find
                    them much improved in farming, and also in<lb/>the disuse of whiskey. And
                    notwithstanding I be-<lb/>lieved his speech was calculated to endeavor to
                    please<lb/>us, and that there was much less sincerity or reality<lb/>in his

                    the way;<lb/> but the tremendous appearance of the way down<lb/>discouraged

                    rest of us followed the officer down and then up<lb/>the craggy, slippery way to
                    the edge of the great<lb/>shoot of water; which together with returning is
                    a<lb/>laborious task, for a believe there were but very few<lb/> dry threads,
                    either linen or woollen, upon any of us<lb/>when we returned. I having four
                    years ago had a<lb/>view and given some description of this amazing
                    cat-<lb/>aract, need not write much now. While I was view-<lb/>ing this
                    superlatively grand and most astonishing<lb/>natural curiosity of the kind in
                    the known world, my<lb/> curiosity would have been fully satisfied had it
                    not<lb/>been for one reflection or consideration, which was<lb/>that I knew my

                    <pb n="612" facs="SW_IC1799_Page_34"/> view I was then favored with, which made me feel as<lb/>though I
                    was only half satisfied. We returned to<lb/><placeName ref="chipp1"
                        >Chippewa</placeName> and lodged, having ridden twenty-four<lb/>miles this

                    rode down the river by the side<lb/>of the rapids above the Falls for a little
                    more than a<lb/>mile and then took another view of the great phenom-<lb/>enon;
                    and I think this morning, the whole of the<lb/>prospect appeared more
                    astonishingly great and beau-<lb/>tiful than I had ever seen it before, it being
                    a clear<lb/>morning, and viewing the great fall and the dash-<lb/>ing of the
                    huge and confused rolls of water over the<lb/>rocks in the rapids between us and
                    the sun, to be<lb/>sure appeared amazingly grand and gratifying. We<lb/>then
                    rode four or five miles to view the whirlpool,<lb/>which four years ago I
                    thought as great a curiosity as<lb/>the other; yet I was disappointed now,
                    though it ap-<lb/>peared a wonderful place, but very far inferior to<lb/>what it
                    did then; there being but few logs in it, and<lb/>whether it was owing to the
                    stillness of the day or<lb/>from some other cause, I know not, there did
                    not<lb/>appear the sucks formed taking down the logs, nor the<lb/>very great
                    agitation there was then. We then rode to<lb/><persName ref="wlund1">Wm.

                    were<lb/> to compose said monthly meeting were furnished<lb/>with religious
                    experience or skill enough<lb/> to be in-<lb/>trusted with power to judge of the
                    fitness of persons<lb/>to be received into membership, or to deny from
                    the<lb/>privileges of the Society. And although there now<lb/> appear to be more
                    in number than there were at<lb/>first opening, and some rather more
                    experienced, yet<lb/>I apprehend they still remain in a very infant

                    <persName ref="jshoe1">John Shoemaker</persName>, and<lb/>I endeavored to draw

                    a<lb/>careless situation respecting the foul channel in which<lb/>they receive
                    or obtain the titles for their lands, or<lb/>whether it would not be better to

                    matter of no consequence, but others expressed<lb/>their dissatisfaction. At

                    the white people from <placeName ref="queen">Queenstown</placeName><lb/> and
                        <placeName ref="niaga">Niagara</placeName>brought their smith work to him.
                    From<lb/>his appearance and disposition of industry, I thought<lb/>our expense

                    which was <persName ref="ejame1">Ezekiel James's</persName>, who were moving

                <p><date when="1803-10-07">7<emph rend="italics">th</emph>.</date> Rode forty miles
                    to <placeName ref="batav">Batavia</placeName>. All the way<lb/>except one or two
                    cabins and a few settlements a lit-<lb/>tle before we came to the town, this
                    day's ride was<lb/>all through the Holland Purchase, and a good deal of<lb/>it
                    very good land, especially near <placeName ref="batav">Batavia</placeName> which
                    is<lb/>the county town of a new county called <placeName ref="genec"

                    court-<lb/>house and jail. When I was through this country<lb/>four years ago,
                    there was no settlement or improve-<lb/>ment from Buffalo to the eastern transit
                    line of<lb/>the Holland land--which is above fifty miles. It is<lb/>surprising
                    how the Eastern or New England men<lb/>open the woods and settle, it being
                    chiefly men from<lb/>those states who emigrate into this new country;
                    and<lb/>although I think the land in general is equal to what<lb/>I conceived it
                    to be when here before, there is one<lb/>very discouraging consideration which
                    is the great<lb/>scarcity of water, we having ridden in one place to-<lb/>day
                    twenty-five miles without finding any for our-<lb/>selves or horses, and in
                    general very scarce. But it<lb/> hath been an uncommon drought at this place.

                    were<lb/>conversed upon which I believe ended to mutual sat-<lb/>isfaction; and
                    I think I was not mistaken when here<lb/>before, when I believed if they
                    improved in a religious<lb/>sense according to their activity and talents,

                    in order to let our horses<lb/>rest and get some of our linen washed. We took
                    the<lb/> opportunity of walking to see some friends and view<lb/>the
                    improvements made by these Eastern people,<lb/>which exceed what can be
                    conceived in the idea of a<lb/> Pennsylvanian or more southern man, for the
                    time.<lb/>They seem as if there were scarcely anything too hard<lb/>or too heavy
                    for them to undertake and go through<lb/>with, especially in opening a new
                    country heavily<lb/>timbered. Said <persName ref="alaph1">Lapham</persName>,
                    though he does not appear<lb/>a robust man, has made a surprising
                    improvement<lb/>for the fime he has been settled here which is about<lb/>eight
                    years; and although there has been an uncom-<lb/>mon drought in this country
                    this year, they have made<lb/>250 cheeses this summer, many of which will
                    weigh<lb/>fifty pounds, and but very few less than thirty pounds,<lb/> which, to
                    be sure, in their cheese-house has a beauti-<lb/>ful appearance. Although I have
                    such an opinion of<lb/>the Eastern men in opening the wilderness, I
                    think<lb/>they are far short of a good Pennsylvania farmer in<lb/>keeping their
                    farms in good order after they have them<lb/>cleared. We propose to lodge
                    another night with these<lb/>our kind friends, <persName rend="alaph1"
                        >Abraham</persName> and <persName ref="elaph1">Esther Lapham,</persName>
                    who<lb/>seem disposed to do everything they can to accommo-<lb/>date us. The
                    neighbors hereabouts have been two<lb/>nights and one day collecting and
                    bringing their hogs<lb/>to Lapham's, and to-morrow morning they propose
                    to<lb/>set off with 250 of them about seven or eight miles into<lb/>the woods to
                    feed upon the acorns and beech nuts<lb/> which are very plenty, and have agreed
                    with four per-<lb/>sons to stay in the woods with them, night and day,<lb/>for
                    about two months; these they call "hog shep-<lb/>herds."</p>

                    part of this stage very poor and some<lb/>of it exceeding rough land. When we
                    arrived at<lb/>
                    <persName ref="mcall1">McAllister's</persName>, I discovered on the sign in
                    large letters,<lb/>"The Practical Farmer," which together with what<lb/>I had
                    heard heretofore of the man's extent and pro-<lb/> ficiency in agriculture,
                    raised my expectations of see-<lb/>ing something extraordinary, but was very
                    much dis-<lb/>appointed, the garden and barn excepted. Break-<lb/>fasted and
                    rode six miles down the river through a<lb/>beautiful country to <placeName
                        key="harrisb">Harrisburg</placeName>, a beautiful town on<lb/>the bank of
                    the river, which I suppose contains 300<lb/> houses; thence to <placeName
                        key="middl">Middletown</placeName>, nine miles, land very<lb/>similar to the
                    last mentioned. This town, I suppose,<lb/> contains about one hundred houses;
                    thence to <placeName ref="eliza"> Eliza-<lb/>bethtown,</placeName> eight miles.
                    One mile after leaving <placeName ref="middl">Mid-<lb/>dletown</placeName>,
                    crossed the beautiful <geogName ref="swata">Swatara</geogName>. Here
                    we<lb/>propose to lodge, and had it not been for the state<lb/>my riding
                    dependence was in, it would have been a<lb/>very pleasant day's travel of
                    thirty-seven miles.</p>
