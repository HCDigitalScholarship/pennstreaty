                <p>The manuscript of Joshua Sharpless’s “Journal into Indian Country, (1798) is
                    housed at Friends Historical Library, on the campus of Swarthmore College. In
                    the spring semester of 2012, Swarthmore students enrolled in English 57A (“Early
                    American Literature Through A Traveler’s Eyes”) transcribed Sharpless’s
                    manuscript as part of a larger project to make the library’s rich store of
                    Quaker journal writings more accessible to researchers. The project was designed
                    by Christopher Densmore, curator of Friends Historical Library, and Keat Murray,
                    Visiting Associate Professor of English. Transcribers included: Kara Stoever
                    (3-38), Kari Olmon (39-74), Zach Wunrow (75-87, 153-174), Margaret Duszyk
                    (88-104), Roberto Conreras (105-123), and David Fialkow (124-152). Students’
                    transcriptions were compiled and edited in the present form by Professor Murray.

            <editorialDecl>
                <p>The transcribers and editor attempted to render Sharpless’s orthography and
                    grammar as they appear on the page of his journal, even when Sharpless’s own
                    spelling and usage are inconsistent. Because the manuscript does not include
                    page numbers, the transcribers have interpolated page numbers.</p>
                <p>[See the “Visit to the Indians in 1798,” published in The Friend beginning in 9
                    Mo. 25, 1847, p. 5 and following. This seems to be a variation with some
                    omissions and numerous minor changes of the Sharpless journal. C.D.]</p>

                <p> A pleasant day, set off with our Indian guide<lb/> he could not talk English,
                    nor understand<lb/> any that we knew of, in less than 2 miles<lb/> we Crossed
                    the <geogName key="conew">Conowanga</geogName> a beautiful<lb/> Stream, which

                    miles, we had a rough Mountainous<lb/> Country, and I think much of it a
                    poor<lb/> thin Soil, <del>we had</del> with a number of very steep<lb/> hills to
                    Ascend and descend, our road<lb/> was better Calculated for an Indian

                    jumped our horses over. When<lb/> we arrived on the <geogName key="alleg"
                        >River</geogName> we stopped a while<lb/> to let our horses eat grass, there

                    us with<lb/> a large turkey on his back, which he had<lb/> Just Shot, we thought
                    it would have weigh-<lb/> -ed more than 20 <del>Lb</del>. the sight of this
                    convey-<lb/> -ed an Idea that small game was plenty a-<lb/> -mongst them, and it
                    was likely we should<lb/> come in for Shares, one of the Canoes also<lb/> had a
                    quantity of fine fish in it. but we<lb/> found when amongst them that a
                    Turkey<lb/> was very seldom taken, or any other small<lb/> game, &amp; it is
                    rare to see a Squirel in the<lb/> Wilderness, we saw some pheasants, but no<lb/>

                        >Cornplanter</persName> came into<lb/> our apartment, and asked us if we

                    were to be eaten together, or<lb/> separate, the bowl contained a number of<lb/>
                    round lumps of something tied in Corn<del>hu</del><lb/> -husks, two dumplings
                    were tyed in one<lb/> set of husks, with a string at each end<lb/> and in the

                    his knife, for they had set neither knives,<lb/> forks, or spoons, and taking up
                    the<lb/> Dumplins he cut one of them in too,<lb/> then striping up the

                    <del>seen</del> since, seen this way of eating is often prac-<lb/> -ticed among

                            going to say to you. – You know<lb/> brothers the Red people are poor,
                            the great<lb/> Spirit has made them of another language,<lb/> so that it
                            is very hard for us to understand<lb/> one another plainly, as there is
                            no person<lb/> here that can interpret very well. <lb/> Brothers, <lb/>
                            we take great pains to settle<lb/> the proposals you made to us, but we
                            differ<lb/> in Opinions, and we must take great<lb/> pains to have every
                            thing compleat <lb/> Brothers,<lb/> we suppose the reason you came
                            here<lb/> was to help Poor Indians some way or other,<lb/> and you wish
                            the Chiefs to tell their Warriors<lb/> not to go on so bad as the have
                            done, and<lb/> you wish us to take up work like the white<lb/> People,
                            now Brothers some of our sober men<lb/> will take take up work, and do
                            as you say,<lb/> and if the do well, then will your young<lb/> Men stay
                            longer, but some others will not<lb/> mind what you say <lb/>
                            <pb n="44" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_046"/> Brothers,<lb/> we cant say a word

                            that<lb/> time we shall know, and then if they like<lb/> it, and we like

                    <del>it</del> the tract lies on the Northwest side of the <geogName key="alleg"
                        >River</geogName>.<lb/> the flat is about 40 reaches wide, and then <lb/>
                    <pb n="50" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_052"/> commences Timber Land, mostly White<lb/>
                    Pine, suitable for building, or Railtim-<lb/> -ber, which Timberland within 60
                    perch-<lb/> -es of the flat we thought pretty good, lies<lb/> very well to the
                    sun, with a gentle Assent,<lb/> and clear of stones; when Viewing this<lb/>
                    land, and taking its local situation in<lb/> -to consideration, we were united
                    in<lb/> believing, that somewhere <del>about</del> near<lb/> this place would be
                    best to make our<lb/> settlement; upon informing two of the Chiefs<lb/> who bore
                    us company, that we thought<lb/> across the upper end of the cleared flat
                    from<lb/> the <geogName key="alleg">River</geogName> back, taking in part of the
                    Wood-<lb/> -land, would be suitable for our purpose,<lb/> and that if they liked
                    it, to tell us, and if the did not<lb/> like it, tell us so, and we would look
                    farther<lb/> where it would suit them better, they said the<lb/> had informed us
                        <del>that</del> all their Land was be-<lb/> -fore us and that we might take
                    it where we liked <del>it</del><lb/> best, and expressed their full
                    satisfaction<lb/> with our choice, <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName>
                    then said, this man,<lb/> meaning one of the Chiefs that was with us,<lb/> lives
                    in this <placeName key="genes1">Town</placeName>, and he is like one of<lb/>
                    <del>us, he</del> you, a sober man, &amp; drinks no Whiskey, and he is very<lb/>
                    glad <del>our</del> the young men are coming to live <del>a-</del><lb/>
                    <del>-mongst them</del> so near him. We informed the Chiefs that<lb/> our Young
                    men would want timber for <lb/>
                    <pb n="51" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_053"/> to build a House, for Rails, and for
                    fire-<lb/> -Wood, to which they readily consented, say-<lb/> -ing, they would be
                    very glad they would cut<lb/> all the Trees down, and further Liberty<lb/> they
                    would give them, if they saw a Buck<lb/> swimming across the River, or
                    running<lb/> through the Woods they might shoot him<lb/> or if they saw any fish
                    in the River they<lb/> might <del>cath</del> catch them, we then returned<lb/>
                    down the <geogName key="alleg">River</geogName> with <persName key="cornp2"

                    <geogName key="alleg">River</geogName> last Spring, sometime after their<lb/>
                    Corn was come up, and by an early Frost<lb/> in the Fall. When enquiring for

                    to send up in the<lb/> boat, we were informed that it was unne-<lb/> -cessary to
                    carry <del>send</del> meat here, for there<lb/> was a plenty in this place,

                    opposite end, ran Births, or<lb/> Seats, they were about four feet wide<lb/> and
                    one foot high, they were covered<lb/> with Boards, and on these Deer-<lb/> skins
                    were spread, and these were<lb/> their Beds, they also make a pretty<lb/> good
                    Seat, and are always ready,<lb/> over these Births, about five feet<lb/> high,
                    are Shelves of the same width<lb/> of <del>those</del> the births

                    -tion answers for most of their Houses, tho<lb/> they are not so large, nor
                    double, like this, they<lb/> are mostly from 12 to 15 feet Square,<lb/> with a
                    shed before the door, there<lb/> are perhaps 30 such houses in this <placeName

                    Houses are beautifully situated on<lb/> the West side of the <geogName
                        key="alleg">River</geogName>, which<lb/> is about 150 Yards wide and
                    glides<lb/> along by the <placeName key="cornp">town</placeName> with a gentle
                    current.<lb/> the bank of the <geogName key="alleg">River</geogName> is low, tho
                    gra-<lb/> -dually asscends to there Houses, which are<lb/> mostly within 6 or 7
                    pearchs so that they<lb/> readily supply themselves with Water <lb/>
                    <pb n="56" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_058"/> there being no springs on the flat
                    where<lb/> the <placeName key="cornp">Town</placeName> stands, which flat is a
                    Sandy<lb/> loam, easily tilled , and if well managed<lb/> would be very
                    productive. there are 50<lb/> or 60 Acres of Land adjoining the <placeName
                        key="cornp">Town</placeName><lb/> nearly cleared, the most of
                        <del>this</del> which is put<lb/> in Yearly with Corn, Beans, and
                    Potatoes.<lb/> the Work is all done by the Women with<lb/> Hoes, they were very
                    busy while we were<lb/> here, much of the Land was grown up<lb/> with Grass,
                    with Weeds &amp;c, they go round<lb/> the Old Cornhills, which were very high,
                    as<lb/> I have observed it is the general practice<lb/> to have a hill when
                    finished near one foot<lb/> high, and hoe the grass and weeds clean<lb/> away,
                    then dig a hole where the hill stood<lb/> and plant in the same place, and
                    sometime after<lb/> the Corn comes up, the hoe all the face of<lb/> the ground
                    over, so that it looked very<lb/> neat. they plant beans with their Corn, also
                    a<lb/> large quantity that they stick poles for,<lb/> they also plant Squashes
                    and Pumpkins among<lb/> their corn - The Women since we came here worked<lb/>
                    hard, they found all their Corn, for homi-<lb/> -ny, and for Bread, sift and
                    prepare it,<lb/> Cut and Split all their Wood, and Carry<lb/> it home on their
                    backs near a Quarter of <lb/>
                    <pb n="57" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_059"/> a Mile, make all there fires, and
                    all<lb/> other Kitchen Business, plant and take<lb/> care of their corn, and
                    gather it when ready,<lb/> Plant their Beans and stick them, and<lb/> as far as
                    I can learn all other out<lb/> doors work, except building their houses<lb/> and
                    Splitting the Rails that the Corn<lb/> Land is enclosed with. It has been a<lb/>
                    busy time since we came here, the Wo-<lb/> -men have rose early, gone out
                    with<lb/> their hoes to the Cornfield 4 or 5 in a<lb/> Company, some of whom
                    where Old Gray<lb/> Headed Women, and some young ones of<lb/> 8, 10, or 12 Years
                    of age, stuck pretty<lb/> Close to their Work, returned in the even-<lb/> -ing
                    weary, and go early to Bed. one<lb/> old Gray Headed Woman I have seen<lb/>
                    steadily on the move, she has had both<lb/> her feet so froze that she goes
                    altogether<lb/> on her knees, I have seen her carrying<lb/> in wood and making
                    the fire, going to the <geogName key="alleg">Ri-<lb/> -ver</geogName> and
                    Bringing up water, I have seen<lb/> take her hoe and go 40 pearches out to <lb/>
                    <pb n="58" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_060"/> the Cornfield, and return in the
                    Even-<lb/> -ing with the Labourers, and put her<lb/> hoe by, and all this while
                    the Men are<lb/> spending their time in Idleness, such as<lb/> shooting with
                    their bows and Arrows at a<lb/> mark which is a very great recreation<lb/>
                    <del>with them,</del> pitching of Queats, Jumping,<lb/> playing at some kind of
                    Games, and on<lb/> Musical Instruments, and loitering about<lb/> so that I have
                    not while in this <placeName key="cornp">Village</placeName> seen<lb/> either
                    Man or Boy at any kind of Work,<lb/> to se little Girls, and Old Women
                    working<lb/> hard with the hoe, and boys of 12, 14, or 16<lb/> just by them all
                    day a playing, looked<lb/> unnatural, hard, and to me very grevi-<lb/> -ous. The

                    Canoe,<lb/> at which they are very handy, there is very<lb/> little game of any
                    kind at this season of<lb/> the year brought in, I have seen but one<lb/> deer
                    all the time we were among them<lb/> and, I have seen no kind of any small<lb/>
                    Game, except the Turkey heretofore noted.<lb/> the Catch a few fish, yet but
                    little was<lb/> done at it while we were there, <lb/>
                    <pb n="59" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_061"/> so that they live poor, their chief
                    subsistence<lb/> at this season was Corn, beans, and Bears<lb/> Oyl, in
                    different preparations, much of their<lb/> Corn and Beans, were pounded into an
                    ho-<lb/> -miny, and Boiled, this I thought was<lb/> their Chief dependence, they
                    also pound<lb/> Corn and Beans in to a flour, and make bread<lb/> of it, they
                    also boyl it in dumplins, which<lb/> they eat with Bear Oyl by dipping it
                    in,<lb/> as they do also with their Bread, they<lb/>
                    <del>also</del> sometimes put Oyl in there ho-<lb/> -miny, <del>they</del> also
                    at times puts sugar in<lb/> it, with which it eats very well, but<lb/> from my
                    observation they eat much less <del>than</del><lb/> than we do, a small piece of
                    Bread or dum-<lb/> -plin dipped in the Oyl seemed to satisfy<lb/> nature, and
                    there seated meals I thought<lb/> were not more than two a day about<lb/> 10 or
                    11 OClock, and in the Evening, if any<lb/> of their friends came to see them,
                    the Visit was<lb/> not interrupted with Cookery, or much<lb/> Cerimony in laying
                    the table &amp;c. if their hominy<lb/> was boiled, which was generally the case
                    af-<lb/> -ter 11 OClock, the day through, and it was<lb/> not material whether
                    Cold or Warm, and<lb/> some of their acquaintance came in, the <lb/>
                    <pb n="60" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_062"/> Births always made a seat ready,
                    wheren<lb/> they were presently engaged in smoak-<lb/> -ing and talking, and
                    while thus busily<lb/> employed, a kettle of hominy with<lb/> a large Wooden
                    spoon, is brought and<lb/> set down on the Ground before them, he<lb/> that is
                    most handy to it lays by his<lb/> Pipe, and in a few minutes appears to be<lb/>
                    satisfyed with his repast, and moves it on<lb/> to the next, while the rest of
                    the Company<lb/> are engaged as if no Victuals were<lb/> near them, thus the
                    Kettle passes <del>th</del><lb/> through the Company in a little time,<lb/> and
                    when done with, hung up, until some<lb/> -body else comes in, if they have
                    no<lb/> hominy, the Bread, or dumplin, goes<lb/> round in like manner; there is
                    no<lb/> trouble of laying, or clearing the ta-<lb/> -ble, or placing of Chairs,
                    Wiping the knives<lb/> and Forks, or Changing of plates, but in<lb/> a simple
                    and easy manner all that<lb/> cerimony is avoided. </p>
                <p> In their Cloathing and Dress their turn<lb/> is for something tawdry; such as a

                    particularly. I have seen bobs<lb/> of various kinds hanging there noses<lb/> to
                    the weight of an Ounce, or more, coming<lb/> down over their Mouth. the
                    Warriors<lb/> have the rim of their Ears cut round,<lb/> and loaded with
                    different kinds of<lb/> Toys, until the hang down several<lb/> Inches. I saw one
                    man with two padlocks<lb/> in one Year, such as are used for Saddle-<lb/> bags,
                    another with a Watch, such as<lb/> Children use. large silver Crosses are<lb/>

                    ruffles to their sleeves<lb/> &amp; Bosoms. the Men and Womens are both
                    made<lb/> in the same form, they come a little lower<lb/> than their Hips, and
                    hangs loose at the<lb/> lower end, the Women wearing their<lb/>

                    petticoats are mostly made of blue<lb/> Cloath, without any needlework,

                    <pb n="62" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_064"/> on about 9 Inches of the upper part;
                    their<lb/> way of making and putting them on is, to take<lb/> a piece of Cloath
                    perhaps 1½ Yards long<lb/> turn down the upper part as above described,
                    which<lb/> part is spread over with Ribbons,<lb/> then Wrap it tite round them,

                    immodest, but it is not the case, for<lb/> a Child is so suckled, and less of

                <p> With all their tawdry and liveliness in<lb/> dress the go dirty, I thought the
                    Women<lb/> more particularly so than the Men, per-<lb/> -haps from their working
                    harder, and<lb/> being more among the grease, some of their shirts<lb/> don’t
                    appear to be ever Washed, and<lb/> about their Sholders the become very<lb/>
                    black and greesy, from their greesy<lb/> heads; their hair I have observed to
                    be<lb/> the Cloath to wipe their greasy fingers <lb/>
                    <pb n="63" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_065"/> in, while eating their bread and
                    Oyl.<lb/> thus for want of a change of Cloaths, and<lb/> living in their dirt,
                    they become <del>very</del><lb/> lowsy, which they try to extrecate them<lb/>
                    -selves from, by pulling of their shifts,<lb/> turning them inside
                        out<del>wards</del>, and<lb/> hunting the Vermon with as much com-<lb/>
                    -possure, and seemingly good grace,<lb/> as a Mother amongst us would do, in
                    <lb/> combing one of her Children, and this<lb/> part of their dirt has not been
                    one of the<lb/> least of our trials, neither have we any<lb/> expectation of
                    leaving them, without<lb/> carrying away some breeders. </p>
                <p> For more than two weeks past the weather<lb/> has been very dry, part of the

                    during which time we slept<lb/> in open Cabins, in our blankets, so that<lb/> we
                    sensible felt the want of more cover-<lb/> -ing, and a better Bed before
                    morning.<lb/> for two or three days past the weather has<lb/> been warm, with a
                    strong South wind.<lb/> the Woods has been much on fire dur-<lb/> -ing this dry

                    the<lb/> Sun has been hid. A curious Sight present-<lb/> -ed two nights ago, of

                    the had not been burnt for seve-<lb/> -ral Years, and the great quantity of

                    we<lb/> again rode the <geogName key="alleg">River</geogName> tho wide and<lb/>
                    deep, we stoped at the House of a Chief who<lb/> went with us to our inten ded

                    not liking it, we proceeded to ano-<lb/> -ther that was on <del>it</del> said
                    settlement wherein a family<lb/> lived, we understood they proposed<lb/> leaving
                    it, and would sell their right,<lb/> upon conferring with the Woman, who<lb/> we
                    understood was the owner of the<lb/> house, she was willing to part with
                    the<lb/> house but having put in a few spots<lb/> with Corn and Vines, the whole
                    not more<lb/> than 3 or 4 pearch Square, she <del>was</del> appeared<lb/>
                    unwilling to relinquish them, and they<lb/> were so in our way, that we thought

                    conferring with her,<lb/> she was willing to part with each of the<lb/> spots
                    except one which was not much in<lb/> our way, and we understanding she<lb/> was
                    a sober Woman that would be likely<lb/> to make good use of the Money, we paid
                    her 20<lb/> dollars for her house and previligdges,<lb/> and with our assistance
                    she removed out<lb/> and in less than an hour we had possission <lb/>

                <p> I neglected noting in its<lb/> proper place, that fifth day last about 11<lb/>
                    OClock we retired into our humble Cabin,<lb/> and were favoured to witness the

                    came to this <placeName key="genes1">Town</placeName>, we brought but<lb/>
                    little provision with us here, having<lb/> but little to bring, and had a hope
                    we<lb/> should have been able to have got<lb/> some dryed Venison of the Indians
                    here, which has<lb/> not been the case, we got a little Bears Oyl<lb/> of them,
                    but that article is scarce, and<lb/> dear, this day intending to have made <lb/>
                    <pb n="72" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_074"/> a dinner of some flitters, our Bread<lb/>
                    being nearly out, and our flour so re-<lb/> -duced as to discourage attempting
                    to<lb/> bake; while we were frying our<lb/> flitters, an Indian man came in<lb/>
                    <del>in</del> and presented us with about four Pounds of fresh Ve-<lb/> -nison
                    without any bone in it; part of<lb/> which we immediately fryed, which<lb/> with
                    our flitters made us the most a-<lb/> -greeable dinner we have met with<lb/> in
                    the Indian Country, we sat down<lb/> to it with thankful hearts for so
                    unex-<lb/> -pected a supply. we gave the Indian<lb/> a Quarter of a dollar, for
                    his Venison,<lb/> which he recieved with an apparant<lb/> reluctance, but as he
                    could not speak <del>no</del><lb/> English, we were altogether at a loss<lb/> to
                    know, whether it proceeded from<lb/> what we gave him being too much, or<lb/>
                    too little, but the same afternoon he took<lb/> three of us down in a Canoe to
                        <placeName key="cornp">Corn-<lb/> -planters Village</placeName> to attend a
                    general<lb/> Council that was to be held there<lb/> tomorrow, he took the Money

                    said<lb/> something to him in Indian, which <del>being</del><lb/> was, that the

                    <pb n="73" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_075"/> a gift, and he wished not to recieve
                    any<lb/> money for it, and the money was handed back<lb/> to us, which we

                    of bringing<lb/> us down in his Canoe, which he reciev-<lb/> -ed with

                        <p> Brothers, you know there are some<lb/> bad People amongst us, and you
                            know<lb/> we have been cheated, and that makes<lb/> us bad, and our
                            Minds uneasy; if we<lb/> had not been cheated we should have<lb/> been
                            very rich People, and had plen-<lb/> -ty of every thing, and then our
                            Minds<lb/> would be easy, and we could think on<lb/> the good
                            Spirit.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, the reason I mention to you a-<lb/> -bout our being Cheated,
                            some of my War-<lb/> -riors wont mind what I say unto them;<lb/> but
                            will have their own way, because<lb/> they know I often have been
                            Cheated<lb/> by the White People; If I had never been<lb/> cheated, then
                            my Warriors would believe<lb/> me, and mind what I say to them, but<lb/>
                            now they wont mind.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, we cant all go to work at once<lb/> some of my Warriors will
                            go a hunting<lb/> to get Provisions, and sometimes they broke <lb/>
                            <pb n="81" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_083"/> a Gun, and then it takes a great
                            deal of<lb/> money to get a new one, we have very<lb/> few Hoes, and
                            Axes, and such things amon-<lb/> -gst us, and we are not able to get
                            them.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, I will go along with you to <placeName key="canan">Canan<lb/>
                                darque</placeName>, and there we will get matters settled<lb/> about
                            the Mill, and bring it back to your<lb/> young men in Writing.</p>
                        <p> Brothers, this is all I have <del>now</del> got to say<lb/> we will now
                            Shake hands.</p>
                    </body>
                </floatingText>

                <p> At the close of this speech we expressed a few words<lb/> more, representing
                    among other things the un-<lb/> -reasonableness of their present practice,
                    of<lb/> their Mothers, Wives, and Sisters, working<lb/> all day in the fields,
                    and in the Woods, with<lb/> their hoes, and axes, whilst they themselves<lb/>
                    were at the same time playing with their<lb/> Bows and Arrows &amp;c
                    recommending to them<lb/> to begin our way by early setting their boys<lb/> to
                    business, taking them out to how Corn &amp;c<lb/> thus by early habitting them
                    to Work, their<lb/> Minds will be turned to it, business will<lb/> become
                    familier, and they will not think<lb/> hard of it. and as they expressed the
                    White<lb/> People were rich and had plenty, we let them <lb/>
                    <pb n="82" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_084"/> know it was by industry it Was
                    obtained<lb/> the men doing their share of business<lb/> in the fields, &amp;c
                    thereby leaving the Wo-<lb/> -men more time to attend to spinning,<lb/> sewing,
                    darying &amp;c in the house.</p>
                <p> We concluded with seriously impressing<lb/> on their Minds the remembrance,
                    that<lb/> it was from the good Spirit they re-<lb/> -cieved every good thing,
                    and that he<lb/> could hear every good Word they said,<lb/> and see every thing
                    they did, and if they<lb/> were good, and industerous, this good<lb/> Spirit
                    would love them, and bless them<lb/> with many good things. In a few
                    minutes<lb/> after we had concluded, and informed them<lb/> we had done,
                        <persName key="cornp2">Cornplanter</persName> Observed, now<lb/> all things
                    were done, and settled, we<lb/> will cover up the Council fire.</p>
                <p> We had no provision of our own here,<lb/> therefore concluded to stay and dine
                    with<lb/> the Chief, about five Oclock we had a<lb/> loaf of Warm Indian Bread
                    with a mix-<lb/> -ture of Beans that had been boiled till<lb/> they were softish
                        <del>nea</del> kneaded up in it<lb/>
                    <del>the Bread and baked</del>
                    <del>that was</del>
                    <del>set before us,</del> the<lb/> bread <del>had been</del>
                    <del>was</del> baked in a Dutch Oven <lb/>
                    <pb n="83" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_085"/> having a small quantity of Bears Oyl
                    put<lb/> into the oven with it, and when part<lb/> baked the loaf was turned
                    over with a<lb/> fresh supply of Oyl, <del>we t</del> this was all we<lb/> had
                    set before us; they informed us they had no<lb/> meat, and we had heretofo shewn
                    our dislike<lb/> to bread diped in Oyl; however with a<lb/> good Appatite it
                    went down very well, but<lb/> before we had fully done a little butter was<lb/>
                    set before us <del>on the Table</del> that they had obtained some<lb/> -where in
                    the Village. -- We now got half<lb/> a £ of flour of <persName key="cornp"
                        >Cornplanter</persName> for which he<lb/> made no charge, and four Quarts of

                    half a dollar a Quart,<lb/> these our Young men took up this evening with

                <p> In the council yesterday we informed the<lb/> Indians that <persName

                    <pb n="84" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_086"/> of the Council we see nothing but

                    should go with him to the<lb/> Council and attend there while the business<lb/>

                    this afternoon we heard an uncommon<lb/> noise, which caused us to look out
                    to<lb/> see from what it proceeded, where we<lb/> saw a Man in a frightful
                    Dress, we<lb/> then walked out more fully to view<lb/> the sight, where we saw
                    two Men<lb/> with naked Arms, Thighs, and legs,<lb/> they had Bearskins on their

                    <pb n="87" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_089"/> which hung down below their hips,

                    they had a grim and Terrible<lb/> appearance, this false face, for so it
                    was<lb/> called, was made as frightfull as nature<lb/> could invent, the hair on
                    its head hang-<lb/> -ing forward and over the face; the Mouth <del>gr</del><lb/>
                    grinning, large, and much aside; the<lb/> nose, and Cheeks Wrinkled and
                    very<lb/> Huge; the Eyes set around with tin to re-<lb/> -semble the uncommon
                    stearing, and the<lb/> whole face painted red and black, each<lb/> of these Men
                    had in their hands a stick<lb/> of about 8 Inches in length fastened<lb/> to a
                    <gap/> shell of a Water Tortise, the <del>which</del><lb/> Shells had some small
                    stones or other<lb/> hand substances in them, which made<lb/> a great rattleing:
                    which noise was much<lb/> much increased by their reubbing<lb/> them against the

                    used <del>their</del> great exertion<lb/> to keep them off, or to catch them, it

                    them of, the horses have been so bit<lb/> with them, that the thin parts of

                    <pb n="101" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_103"/> and a green headed fly will be so
                    trou-<lb/> -blesome in a while, that horses and Cattle<lb/> wont thrive or will
                    rather fall away.<lb/> After waiting with some degree of impatience<lb/> until
                    between two and three OClock this<lb/> afternoon, we were visited by <persName

                    which<lb/> he was very sorry, but if we did not like to<lb/> wait so long, he
                    would hire a guide and send<lb/> with us. We informed him we were<lb/> very

                    having his com-<lb/> -pany, but believed it would be best for<lb/> us to set of
                    tomorrow Morning, for we<lb/> wished to spend a few days with our friend<lb/> in

                    about 5 OClock<lb/> we took an affectionate farewell of<lb/> our Young Friends
                    and set of for the<lb/> mouth of <geogName key="buffr">Buffaloe</geogName>, we
                    went up the <geogName key="alleg">Ri-<lb/> -ver</geogName> about five miles,
                    through a very<lb/> thick Wood, and a great quantity of<lb/> Windfel timber,
                    there was a large pro-<lb/> -portion of young stuff growing up, and<lb/> next to
                    no path; we frequently got very<lb/> wet from the bushes, we then left the

                    Country<lb/> heavily timbered, mostly white pine, having <lb/>

                    entred<lb/> a rough hilly country, heavy timbred, mostly hemlock and I thought
                    thin land for 7 or 8 miles a<lb/> large quantity of which was down, so that<lb/>

                    <del>the</del> swampy gutts it required patience and a good<lb/> Stock of
                    Spirits; I mentioned to my Companion<lb/> sometime after we set of this
                        <del>this</del> morning<lb/> that my Mind, was uncommonly easy, cheer-<lb/>
                    -ful, and sweet, so that I passed along, in a<lb/> lively and well qualifyed
                    state to make tra-<lb/> veling pleasant, but before Evening I foun[d]<lb/> my
                    stock of spirits was much exhausted. About<lb/> 11 O Clock we had a very heavy
                    Rain, such an<lb/> one as but seldom happens, it lasted perhaps<lb/> an hour, so
                    that we got very wet, when it<lb/> abated we stopped and barked some trees<lb/>
                    to have a trough to feed our horses out<lb/> of, and taking some refreshment
                    ourselves<lb/> we mounted, having for several miles past<lb/> been riding over
                    fine <del>Champion</del> land, a little<lb/> hilly and <del>heavily</del> loaded
                    with <del>and</del> timber<del>ed</del>, we had some fears about <lb/>
                    <pb n="104" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_106"/> about getting over <geogName key="catar"
                        >Catarawgus</geogName> this morn-<lb/> -ing before we started, and this
                    heavy<lb/> rain increased them; however we mov-<lb/> -ed on over a fine country,
                    tho a trying road<lb/> the Limbs, the Brush and the Logs were<lb/> ever in our
                    way, much of the Timber in<lb/> this days ride has been Hemlock, some<lb/>
                    Chesnut, Sugar maple, Beech, Oak &amp;c but<lb/> as we advanced towards
                        <geogName key="catar">Catarawgus</geogName>, we<lb/> had a large proportion
                    of very fine<lb/> poplars; when we got near to the <geogName key="catar"

                    rich<lb/> bottom, with an uncommon luxuriant growth of vegetation and about
                    sunset arrived at<lb/> the stream, which we found to be many<lb/> pearches out
                    of its banks at the Common<lb/> fording place, and our guide signed to us<lb/>
                    that it would run over our horses backs<lb/> and sweep them away; we therefore

                    up a fire, and under some Bushes, we had<lb/> put up to keep of the due, got a

                    was<lb/> rather heightened by our being so long confined<lb/> in the Woods. The
                    road was in places<lb/> good, but in other places very heavy,<lb/>

                    gently to the shore in waves two or three<lb/> feet high. On our Right was a
                    Majestick ap-<lb/> -pearance of rocks and stones piled up<lb/> in verey uniform
                    order, in places from<lb/> 20 to 60 feet high, as upright as the Wall<lb/> of a
                    house, and in other places projecting<lb/> over several feet, the bottom of

                    <del>wore</del> with the bearing of the<lb/> Waves, and Sand, and Gravel,

                    <del>they are</del> were wore into Curious shapes, and<lb/> as smooth as

                    Rocks standing in the edge<lb/> of the Water, as large over, and round<lb/> as a
                    Millstone, the upper part whereof <lb/>
                    <pb n="110" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_112"/> was wore nearly to the shape of the
                    largest<lb/> end of an Egg, &amp; as round as if turned<lb/> in a leathe. In a
                    number of places<lb/> the water came up to the Wall of Rocks,<lb/> so that we
                    had to ride 40 or more pearch-<lb/> -es in the <del>Water</del> Lake in places
                    Belly deep,<lb/> and the Water was very dirty at the<lb/> Shore with its beating
                    the sand &amp;c so<lb/> that we could not see the bottom, and<lb/> did not know
                    but the next step the<lb/> horses made might take them over<lb/> their Backs,
                    but what made it look<lb/> the most romantic was the continu-<lb/> -al beating
                    of the Waves, which came<lb/> up against these Rocks, and the Wa-<lb/> -ter
                    would at times fly over our heads<lb/> and sufficeintly wet the traveller.
                    The<lb/> last 10 miles we very much left the Rocks,<lb/> and as we advanced the
                    bank grew lower,<lb/> so that very high Westerly Winds raises<lb/> the

                    drowns a considerable Country, which is very<lb/> level, and Wet for Common. It
                    was very<lb/> evident for a number of Miles here away <lb/>
                    <pb n="111" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_113"/> that the <geogName key="lakee"
                        >Lake</geogName> is gradually moving towards<lb/> the Southeast as most of
                    the trees which<lb/> stand along its margin has the dirt washed<lb/> away from
                    their roots for 3, 4, or more feet<lb/> deep, <del>and</del> so that they are
                    dead &amp; falling fast; and<lb/> I thought it was as visible when on the<lb/>

                    at the <geogName key="niagf">falls</geogName> I once more gratified my Eyes<lb/>
                    in beholding this Wonderfull Phinomina<lb/> in nature, the appearance was

                    think it not necessary to add, further<lb/> than we now went down a very steep

                    <pb n="115" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_117"/> believe had we stayed on the Rock at

                    been glad to have<lb/> descended to the bottom of this pitch, but<lb/> we had no
                    pilat, and there was no possibility<lb/> of getting down any where in view, nor

                    there,<lb/> &amp; that they thought our Coming was Pro-<lb/> -vidential. They

                    black mud on the<lb/> top and a stiff Clay under, which<lb/> Clay prevents the
                    Water from soaking<lb/> down, when cleared in a dry time<lb/> this Clay land
                        <del>beakes</del> bakes very hard &amp;<lb/> is difficult tilling, tho in

                    The land in general is<lb/> of a good quality and a fine grass land,<lb/> good
                    springs of water are scarce, as are<lb/> lively runing Streams: and the
                    Waters<lb/> fail much in dry Weather. In places<lb/> there are a plenty of a

                    Scarcely a spot to be met<lb/> with, except where it is cleaned, but what<lb/>
                    is very heavy, Timbered Land. I do<lb/> not recollect of ever passing through

                    him<lb/> near a Year before he had got back, and<lb/> that he had found it his

                    informed us he was become per-<lb/> -fectly reconciled to our going, and as<lb/>

                    at our own<lb/> homes, he further desired we would<lb/> make ourselves,
                    perfectly easy about<lb/> our Young Men, who were left a-<lb/> mong his People,
                    for he would take<lb/> the necessary care of them, and that they<lb/>

                <p> We now took An affectionate farewell of<lb/> the Chief, and the Indians present,

                <p> Much of this days ride was through a country<lb/>

                    grown over with plenty of pretty good grass,<lb/> so that I thought thousands of

                    species of large flies, and Musche-<lb/> -toes, we stoped twice to let our

                    <pb n="130" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_132"/> grass, but they were so Worried with
                    these<lb/> Animals, that the did little but run about<lb/> until we got bushes
                    and kept them of.<lb/> If we stoped our horses one Minute in<lb/> some places in
                    the Woods, the Musche-<lb/> -toes would be on them in such swarms<lb/> as almost
                    to hide their natural Colour,<lb/> and none but those who have experienced<lb/>
                    <del>it</del> the trial can rightly form an Idea, how trou-<lb/> blesome the

                    with my Silk handkerchief, laped<lb/> my Pocket do: around one of my hands<lb/>
                    and with all the <del>other</del> defence I could<lb/> make was much bit and
                    Swelled with<lb/> them, -- When Night came <del>an</del> we got<lb/> no relief,
                    we took up our quarters, a-<lb/> -bout Sunset, beside a small stream<lb/> of
                    good Water, under the Boughs of an<lb/> Oak, and erected fires, in
                    diffirent<lb/> places around us in order to smoke<lb/> them of, but with all our
                    defence we<lb/> were worried the whole night throug[h] <lb/>
                    <pb n="131" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_133"/> So that we slept but little, our

                    out to eating,<lb/> and then in a little time return trot-<lb/> -ting back to

                <p> The common practice of raising Corn,<lb/> wheat &amp;c for many Miles past, is

                    sow it with wheat and<lb/> Timothy, and often times some Clover seed, and when
                    the Wheat comes<lb/> of, mow it for several years, by that time<lb/> many of the

                    accomplish it until we came,<lb/> we made some fresh proposals to them con-<lb/>
                    -cerning some of their young men coming to<lb/> work on the farm with our

                    <del>they were to receive</del> for their labour, they<lb/> apprehended at too
                    great a difference, it be-<lb/> -ing such a share of what was raised. There<lb/>
                    were also some proposials concerning one<lb/> or two of their Young Men coming
                    to learn <lb/>
                    <pb n="148" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_150"/> the Smith trade, all which they
                    said<lb/> they would take under consideration and<lb/> let us know tomorrow,
                    then they were clos[e]<lb/> -ly expostulated with, concerning some Jea-<lb/>
                    -louses they had entertained, occationed by<lb/> some whisperings of evel Minded

                    to <del>make</del> get pos-<lb/> -session of their Lands, for they
                    certainly<lb/> would not have been at the great expence<lb/> they have, if they
                    did not expect some<lb/> temporal advantage therefrom; they<lb/> acknowledged
                    they had given too much place<lb/> in their Minds to such Whisperings, and<lb/>
                    that it had made them feel, to use there<lb/> own expressions, very ugly, we let
                    them<lb/> know that we would not have their Land<lb/> if they would give it to
                    us, and that it was<lb/> very unkind in them to have given place<lb/> to such
                    surmisings without they had, had<lb/> some ground for it <del>them</del>, they
                    acknow-<lb/> -ledged they had found us to be true Men,<lb/> that we Spoke the
                    same words to them<lb/> now, we Spoke <del>two</del> too them two years ago <lb/>
                    <pb n="149" facs="SW_JS1798_Page_151"/> and that they would Shut their Ears to
                    all<lb/> such Whisperings in future. Then said, they<lb/> had been trying to
                    improve in farming, and<lb/> if they did not come forward as fast, and as<lb/>
                    well as <del>we desired</del> the Quakers desired,<lb/> they must not get
                    discouraged, but conti-<lb/> -nue there care, and Assistance towards them.</p>
                <p> Upon enquiring of our young Men here, they<lb/> informed us there was some

                    are computed young and old <del>to amount to</del> at<lb/> about 600, and are

                    was sown with wheat, which<lb/> was mostly light. Not so much Rye as<lb/>
                    further back. Thence throug good land,<lb/> thick settled, and a beautiful
