                    populate his journal, and Indian villages and towns. The transcribers and editor

                <head>JOURNAL.</head>
                <p>Many of my friends having been solicitous<lb/> for the privilege of a perusal of
                    the minutes I<lb/> preserved in the course of my late visit to the<lb/> Western
                    Indians, I have been induced to devote<lb/> a small portion of leisure time to
                    the purpose of<lb/> attempting such an arrangement of them, as<lb/> would
                    convey, intelligibly, both the route we<lb/> took, and the various circumstances
                    attending<lb/> upon our journey.</p>
                <p>The judicious reader will doubtless make<lb/> proper allowances for the
                    difficulty there is in<lb/> composing an entertaining diary over that of a<lb/>
                    history, where circumstances are not necessarily<lb/> confined to day and
                    time.</p>
                <p>As a suitable introduction to my Journal, I<lb/> deem it proper to insert the
                    following letter. It<lb/> will serve to show the intercourse which had<lb/>
                    previously taken place between the <orgName key="bymindian">Indian<lb/>

                        <p>-We<lb/> have received you speech from the hand of our<lb/> friend,
                                <persName key="wwell1">Wm. Wells</persName>, with the implements
                            of<lb/> husbandry, that you were so kind to send to his<lb/> care,-all
                            in good order.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, it is our wish that the Great Spirit<lb/> will enable you to
                            render to your Red Brethren<lb/> that service which you appear to be so
                            desirous<lb/> of doing them, and which their women and<lb/> children are
                            so much in need of.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we will try to use the articles you<lb/> have sent us, and if
                            we should want more, we<lb/> will let you know it.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we are sorry to say that the minds<lb/> of our people are not
                            so much inclined towards<lb/> the cultivation of the earth as we could
                            wish<lb/> them. </p>
                        <p>Brothers, our Father, the President of the<lb/> United States, has
                            prevented our traders from<lb/> selling liquor to our people, which is
                            the best<lb/> thing he could do for his Red Children.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, our people appear dissatisfied, be-<lb/>cause our traders do
                            not, as usual, bring them<lb/> liquor, and, we believe, will request our
                            Father<lb/> to let the traders bring them liquor, and if he<lb/> does,
                            your Red Brethren are all lost forever.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, you will see, from what we have<lb/><pb n="5"/> said, that our
                            prospects are bad at present,<lb/> though we hope the Great Spirit will
                            change the<lb/> minds of our people, and tell them it will be<lb/>
                            better for them to cultivate the earth than to<lb/> drink whiskey.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we hope the Great Spirit will per-<lb/>mit some of you to come
                            and see us,- when you<lb/> will be able to know whether you can do
                            any-<lb/>thing for us or not.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we delivered you the sentiments of<lb/> our hearts, when we
                            spoke to you at <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore,</placeName>* <note

                    of 37 miles.</p>
                <p>A snow has been falling for some hours upon<lb/> the remains of a former snow ten
                    inches in<lb/> depth. Our journey to-day has been very en-<lb/>tertaining,
                    notwithstanding the severity of the <lb/><pb n="10"/> weather, and the danger at
                    this time attendant,<lb/> on climbing up and descending precipices.</p>
                <p>There is much in a journey over these moun-<lb/>tains to puzzle, as well as
                    amuse, the naturalist.<lb/> Many extraordinary natural curiosities have<lb/>
                    fallen under our observation, in the diversified<lb/> appearance of mountains,
                    rocks and valleys. We<lb/> have passed to-day the most ponderous, craggy
                    and<lb/> over-jutting rocks we have heretofore met with,<lb/> many of which were
                    elevated several hundred<lb/> feet above our heads, and seemed to threaten
                    us<lb/> with impending danger; which was not a little<lb/> magnified, in our
                    apprehensions, from observing<lb/> cast bodies of rock, which had evidently
                    tum-<lb/>bled from their lofty summits into the valleys.<lb/> Had we been
                    disposed to indulge fancy, we<lb/> might have figured to ourselves, in a view
                    of<lb/> these rude mountains of rocks, many of those<lb/> descriptions met with
                    in Roman, Greek or<lb/> Egyptian history, of amphitheatres, obelisks,<lb/>
                    pyramids, &amp;c. &amp;c; whilst many others exhibit-<lb/>ed such regular, wavy
                    appearences, interspersed<lb/> alternately with oaks and pines, and soil of<lb/>
                    various hues, as seemed to challenge the painter<lb/> with his diversified
                    shades of coloring. And could<lb/> we have observed here goats, white bears
                    and<lb/> reindeer, with now and then a human being<lb/> clothed in skins and
                    furs, and with weather a<lb/> little colder, we might, perhaps, have been
                    led<lb/> to suppose ourselves in Lapland. A few settle-<lb/>ments are made in
                    this tract, which are mostly<lb/><pb n="11"/> in the valleys. Deer are said to
                    be very numerous<lb/> upon these mountains-several were seen by us.<lb/> We also
                    observed seats erected in the branches<lb/> of the trees by the hunters, twenty
                    feet in height,<lb/> being concealed stations for the purpose of shoot-<lb/>ing
                    deer at the Salt Licks. We have also seen<lb/> several flocks of turkeys and

                    judging. We also crossed over that<lb/> part of the <geogName key="allmo"
                        >Alleghany ridge</geogName> which divides the<lb/> eastern and western

                    most beautiful and lofty forest of<lb/> spruce and pine I ever saw. This forest
                    is call-<lb/>ed the Shades. The trees are generally from<lb/> 108 to 180 feet in
                    height, with a body not<lb/> more than 12 inches in diameter at the surface<lb/>
                    of the earth.</p>
                <p>We also forded one of the branches of the<lb/>

                    <geogName key="negm">Negro Mountain</geogName>. On inquiring into the
                        origin<lb/><pb n="12"/> of the name of the latter, we were informed<lb/>
                    that many years ago, a white man and a negro<lb/> who were hunting together,
                    accidentally fell in<lb/> with an Indian upon this ridge who was armed;<lb/>
                    both the negro and the Indian betook them-<lb/>selves to trees, presented their
                    guns at each<lb/> other, and fired at the same moment, and both<lb/> fell dead.
                    Thier images are cut upon the trees<lb/> behind which they fell, as a memento of
                    the<lb/> circumstance. The ridge has ever since been<lb/> called the <geogName
                        key="negm">Negro Mountain.</geogName></p>
                <p>Deer and turkies are numerous upon these<lb/> mountains. The hunters have in many
                    places<lb/> erected seats, as heretofore described, for the pur-<lb/>pose of
                    shooting deer.</p>
                <p>Over the greater part of our journey to-day<lb/> we have found snow two feet in
                    depth. A tolera-<lb/>ble track is however beaten for us by a descrip-<lb/>tion
                    of pedlars, who pass by the name of Packers.<lb/> These people carry on a

                    part of that State.</p>
                <p>They take with them upon horses, bags of<lb/> flax, which article they purchase
                    at <placeName key="redst1">Redstone</placeName> at<lb/> a low price; this they
                    dispose of at an advance,<lb/> and in return carry salt, for which they are
                    well<lb/> paid at <placeName key="redst1">Redstone</placeName>. It is not
                    unusual to meet a<lb/> Packer, having under his direction half a dozen<lb/>

                    the beaten path. We<lb/><pb n="13"/> were several times under difficulties in

                        key="gmead">Great Meadows</placeName> is very<lb/> level and the timber
                    heavy, which indicates the<lb/> goodness of the soil. A considerable body
                        of<lb/><pb n="14"/>this land was owned by <persName key="gwash1"
                        >Washington</persName> at the time<lb/> of his death.</p>
                <p>This day's journey has been very disagreeable<lb/> and cold, owing to a continued
                    fall of snow.<lb/> We greatly regretted that the clouds prevented<lb/> a view of
                    the <placeName key="redst1">Redstone</placeName> settlements from the top<lb/>
                    of <placeName key="laure">Laurel Hill</placeName>, this being that part of the
                        <geogName key="allmo">Alle­<lb/>ghany Mountains</geogName> from which a
                    descent is made<lb/> into the country below. From this commanding<lb/> eminence
                    the prospect, we are told, is beautiful<lb/> beyond description.</p>
                <p>Our disappointment, however, was in some<lb/> measure recompensed by finding
                    ourselves, when<lb/> upon the top of this hill, not only above the<lb/> clouds,
                    but also so elevated in a cloud as to find<lb/> the particles of snow resembling
                    fog; a proof<lb/> that large spits of snow, as they are called, ac­<lb/>quire
                    their size by an accumulation of particles<lb/> on their way from the clouds to
                    the earth. I may<lb/> here mention, that the difficulties and fatigues<lb/> of
                    our journey thus far have been rendered light<lb/> by the agreeable company of
                    my brother-in-law,<lb/>

                        <p>My dear Brothers, Quakers, listen to what<lb/> I now say to you. You

                <p>About the time of the reception of this letter,<lb/> some Friends, who resided
                    nearest to their hunt-<lb/>ing camp, furnished them with a small supply<lb/> of

                        <p>Brother Quakers, I have a few more words<lb/> to say to you.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, I want that you should all know<lb/> what distress I am in.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, I want you to know I have got<lb/> help from some of my near

                        <p>Brothers, I would be glad to know what you<lb/> will do for me, if it is
                            but a little.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, if you cannot come soon, it will<lb/> do bye and bye, for my
                            belly is now full.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, I hope you have not forgot our<lb/> great fathers; when they
                            first met, it was in<lb/> friendship; we are of the same race.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers, Quakers, I hope our friendship<lb/> will last as long as the
                            world stands. All I have<lb/>to say to you now is, that I shall stay
                            here until<lb/> two more moons are gone.</p>

                <p>A considerable quantity of provisions were<lb/> furnished by the Friends to these
                    Indians, for <lb/><pb n="17"/> which they expressed great thankfulness.
                        <persName key="tarh1">Tar-<lb/>hie</persName> himself divided the presents
                    between man<lb/> and man, making no difference for distinction<lb/> in rank.</p>
                <p>These Friends were informed by <persName key="trah1">Tarhie</persName>, that<lb/>
                    several years ago he had sent a talk to the <orgName key="bymindian"
                        >In-<lb/>dian Committee at <placeName key="balti1"
                        >Baltimore</placeName></orgName>, accompanied by a<lb/> belt of wampum,
                    worth fifty dollars, and had<lb/> long been waiting for an answer, but had
                    not<lb/> yet received one.</p>
                <p>In consequence of this information, a confer-<lb/>ence was held at <placeName
                        key="redst1">Redstone</placeName>, between such of the<lb/> members of the
                        <orgName key="bymindian">Indian Committee</orgName> as could be<lb/>
                    convened there. The result was a request made<lb/> to four Friends of the
                    neighborhood adjacent to<lb/> the Indian camp, to visit <persName key="tarh1"
                        >Tarhie</persName>, and inform him<lb/> that his talk was not received by
                    the <orgName key="bymindian">Indian<lb/> Committee</orgName>, and that his belt
                    of wampum never<lb/> came to their hands. Also, if he had any thing<lb/> now to
                    say, he must write again to the <orgName key="bymindian">Indian<lb/>
                        Committee</orgName>.</p>
                <p>During our stay at <placeName key="redst1">Redstone</placeName>, we had an
                    op-<lb/>portunity of seeing and admiring the richness<lb/> of the land between
                    the foot of the <geogName key="allmo">Alleghany<lb/> Mountains</geogName> and
                    the <geogName key="monon">Monongahela River</geogName>. The<lb/> people here
                    seem to live in ease and plenty, and<lb/> there is scarcely a plantation that
                    does not afford<lb/> stone coal and sugar trees. The coal is, I think,<lb/>
                    fully equal in quality to the best Liverpool coal,<lb/> and is generally used
                    for fuel in the place of<lb/>wood; it being much easier and cheaper to pro-<lb/>
                    <pb n="18"/>cure a supply of coal, than to procure wood, not-<lb/>withstanding
                    that article is in great plenty here.</p>
                <p>The sugar trees afford sugar in plenty to those<lb/> who are sufficiently
                    industrious to make it. Many<lb/> families, we are told, make from five hundred
                    to<lb/> a thousand pounds, and others make from eight-<lb/>een to twenty-five
                    hundred weight, every spring.<lb/> The trees do not appear to be injured by
                    draw-<lb/>ing off the sap. Molasses of excellent quality<lb/> is also made from
                    this tree, and also small beer,<lb/> equal to any thing of the kind we met with
                    at<lb/> this place, produced from the sap.</p>
                <p>Shall I say, a proof of the instability of the<lb/> human mind, under the most
                    bountiful supply of<lb/> temporal blessings, is to be drawn from the
                    pre-<lb/>sent disposition of the inhabitants of <placeName key="redst1"
                        >Redstone</placeName>?<lb/> Blest with a country rich and fruitful, and
                    posses-<lb/>sing other great natural advantages, there is<lb/> nevertheless a
                    general feeling of discontent. The<lb/> new country beyond the <geogName
                        key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>, lately opened for<lb/> sale, has set the
                    general mind afloat. We saw<lb/> people who were well settled, and who some<lb/>
                    years ago, too, had passed the meridian of life,<lb/> strongly affected with the
                    prevailing mania.</p>

                    we are greatly disappointed in our wish<lb/> and intention to take boat at

                    no other alternative than to prosecute<lb/> a long and doubtless fatiguing
                    journey by land.<lb/> This morning, whilst we were preparing to pro-<lb/><pb
                        n="19"/>eed on our route, two young men arrived at our<lb/> quarters, for
                    the purpose of accompanying us;<lb/> one of them a blacksmith, and a member of
                    our<lb/> Society, the other a carpenter, and a steady young<lb/> man. They are
                    under the pay of government,<lb/> and have engaged to reside in the
                    neighborhood<lb/> of <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>, to be
                    employed for the benefit<lb/> and instruction of the Indians. Previous to
                    our<lb/> leaving home, we had reason to expect that we<lb/> should be overtaken
                    by these young men, and<lb/> were glad to have our expectations realized.</p>
                <p>Again proceeding on our journey, we passed<lb/> through <placeName key="brown"
                        >Brownsville</placeName>, a village on the <geogName key="monon"
                        >Mononga-<lb/>hela River</geogName>; crossed over that river in a boat,
                    and<lb/> rode about twenty-six miles to <placeName key="wash2"
                        >Washington</placeName>, an<lb/> inland town. Our ride to-day has been
                    through<lb/> a very hilly country, tolerably rich, though badly<lb/> watered. It
                    is said that one of the first survey-<lb/>ors of this tract of country, when
                    questioned re-<lb/>specting its general appearance, replied, <said
                        who="undetermined">It is<lb/> like a large meadow filled with stacks of
                        hay.</said><lb/> A comparison very apropos.</p>
                <p>It is worthy of remark, that near <placeName key="brown"
                    >Brownsville,</placeName><lb/> on the <geogName key="monon"
                        >Monongahela,</geogName> are the remains of an old<lb/> fortification,
                    including several acres of ground.<lb/> Mussel shells are yet very abnndant
                    within the<lb/> intrenchment; and nearly opposite to the forti-<lb/>fication are
                    two fish pots extending quite across<lb/> the river; they are made of stone,
                    weighing gene-<lb/>rally from thirty to forty pounds. It is said that<lb/> the
                    Indians who resided near the spot at the time<lb/><pb n="20"/> of its discovery
                    by the white men, had not even<lb/> a traditional knowledge of the making of
                    these<lb/> fish pots, nor of the erection of the fortification. </p>
                <p>This day, in passing along, my mind has been<lb/> involved in much serious
                    reflection on the im-<lb/>portance of our mission. And I trust I have in<lb/> no
                    small degree felt the responsibility we are<lb/> under, not to men only, but to
                    the Great Author<lb/> of all good, with an ardency not to be expressed,<lb/>
                    that we may indeed discharge the trust reposed<lb/> in us, and perform the duty

                        <placeName key="westl">West Liberty</placeName>. The tract of coun-<lb/>try
                    through which we have travelled is generally<lb/> fertile and is mostly settled.
                    In the course of<lb/> this day's ride, it is observable that limestone is<lb/>
                    to be found on the tops of the highest hills, but<lb/> is rarely found in the
                    bottoms.</p>
                <p>It may now be noted that the hills between<lb/> the <geogName key="monon"
                        >Monongahela</geogName> and the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio rivers</geogName>
                    are gene-<lb/>rally of a very singular description, having two<lb/> or three
                    circular elevations, the surface of each<lb/> elevation flat for the space of
                    twenty-five to<lb/> thirty feet in diameter. These flat appearances<lb/> extend
                    quite around the circumference of the<lb/> hills, and seem to vie with art for
                    regularity.</p>
                <p>This day we crossed in a boat the great <geogName key="ohior">river<lb/><pb
                            n="21"/> Ohio</geogName>. On approaching it, I felt no small degree<lb/>
                    of awe. The slow and majestic movement of so<lb/> vast a body of running water,
                    added to the re-<lb/>collection of the blood which had been spilt re-<lb/>lative
                    to its shores, enforced the sensation. With<lb/> what obstinacy the poor Indians
                    resisted the de-<lb/>signs of the white men in making settlements<lb/> west of
                    this river! Having been driven further<lb/> and further westward, relinquished
                    claim to tract<lb/> after tract, they here made a stand, fixed in a
                    re-<lb/>solve, hitherto ye may come, but no farther!<lb/> This river shall be
                    the boundary between us!<lb/> It shall limit your encroachment! The
                    resist-<lb/>ance they made, and the blood which was split,<lb/> sufficiently
                    prove the reluctance with which they<lb/> gave up the contest. The bottom upon
                    the west<lb/> side of the river where we crossed, which was at<lb/> the junction
                    of <placeName key="shortc">Short Creek</placeName>, is very rich, but not<lb/>
                    wide. In this bottom we observed a mound of<lb/> earth cast up to the height of
                    fifteen feet, its<lb/> diameter at the base forty-five feet, and said to<lb/> be
                    a burial place, but whether made by the In-<lb/>dians or not is not ascertained.
                    It is said that<lb/> two miles below this is a square fortification<lb/>
                    containing several acres of ground, enclosed by<lb/> a bank of earth thrown up
                    by art to the height<lb/> of eight feet.</p>
                <p>Along the east shore of the river great de-<lb/>struction was made a few years
                    ago by a species<lb/> of caterpillar which infested the trees. They<lb/> fed
                    upon the leaves, and thus killed trees of<lb/><pb n="22"/> enormous size. Their
                    havoc extended for many<lb/> miles along the river, and reached about seven<lb/>
                    or eight miles from the shore. </p>

                <p>This day being First-day, we rested<lb/> ourselves and horses, and were glad to
                    have an<lb/> opportunity of attending a meeting of Friends,<lb/> called <orgName
                        key="short">Short Creek</orgName> Meeting. A Monthly Meet-<lb/>ing is lately
                    established here by <orgName key="redst">Redstone Quar-<lb/>terly
                        Meeting</orgName>. About forty Friends were at<lb/> this meeting, and most
                    of them were new settlers.<lb/> The greater number had moved from <placeName
                        key="ncaro">North<lb/> Carolina</placeName>. The meeting was held in a log
                    house<lb/> or cabin, situated upon a beautiful hill, covered<lb/> with lofty
                    timber. The difficulties and incon-<lb/>veniences of a new settlement, are
                    rendered the<lb/> more easy and tolerable, where, as in the instance<lb/> of
                    these Friends, a number of families, by agree-<lb/>ment, form a settlement in
                    the same neighbor-<lb/>hood. In the afternoon several of them visited<lb/> us at
                    our lodgings, and expressed sympathy with<lb/> us in our undertaking.</p>

                <p>Proceeded on our journey; travelled<lb/> thirty-one miles and reached <placeName
                        key="randt">Randallstown</placeName>; part<lb/> of the day has been rainy,
                    and the riding very<lb/> disagreeable. We have passed through a body<lb/> of
                    land heavily timbered and very rich. There<lb/> are yet but few settlements made
                    on this tract.<lb/> The first settlers in this new country erect small<lb/> log
                    cabins, which they cover with split timber<lb/> called puncheons; these they pin
                    to the rafters<lb/><pb n="23"/> with wooden pins. Nails are rarely to be
                    found<lb/> in any part of the house. Their floors are hewn<lb/> out of the
                    timber, and pinned to the sleepers<lb/> with wooden pins. They clear their land
                    by<lb/> killing the timber, which is done by girdling the<lb/> trees, that is by
                    cutting the bark around the<lb/> trees to the wood. They then proceed to
                    the<lb/> cultivation of the soil, which produces them abun-<lb/>dant crops.</p>
                <p>It is a common practice with them to sow<lb/> small grain upon the original
                    surface, which is<lb/> harrowed in, and such is the looseness and
                    light-<lb/>ness of the soil, there seems but little necessity<lb/> for the
                    plough in raising the first crop of grain.</p>
                <p>Our road led us across a water of the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName><lb/>
                    called <geogName key="capte">Captena</geogName>; also several streams belonging

                <p>This day we travelled twenty-five miles<lb/> and reached <placeName key="beath"
                        >Beathe's Ordinary</placeName>. We have had<lb/> a very disagreeable day's
                    ride. A continued fall<lb/> of rain, hail, and snow, and the road very miry<lb/>
                    and fatiguing to our horses. The land through<lb/> which we have passed not
                    quite so good gene-<lb/>rally as that noted yesterday. We, however,<lb/> saw
                    considerable bodies of excellent land, parti-<lb/>cularly of bottoms. Some of
                    them were of far<lb/> greater extent than any we have heretofore met<lb/> with,
                    being heavily timbered and very rich.<lb/> Scarcely a settlement has yet been
                    made in this<lb/><pb n="24"/> tract; deer are very plenty here. It is to be
                    re-<lb/>marked, that in riding the last fifty miles, we<lb/> have scarcely seen
                    one of any of the descriptions<lb/> of the feathered tribes, except owls. Birds
                    love<lb/> to resort to the haunts of men.</p>
                <p>Squirrels appear to be very numerous, and<lb/> are mostly of a deep black color.
                    In the notes<lb/> made on crossing the <geogName key="allmo">Alleghany
                        Mountains</geogName>, I<lb/> omitted to observe that the squirrels we
                    saw<lb/> there were mostly red, and less in size than the<lb/> grey squirrels of
                        <placeName key="maryl">Maryland</placeName>. They are the most<lb/> active
                    squirrel I ever saw, and are called by the<lb/> mountaineers the Chipparee
                    Squirrel. </p>
                <p>We this day crossed several of the branches of<lb/><geogName key="willc">Will's

                        <geogName key="willc">Will's Creek</geogName> and a <lb/> water called
                        <geogName key="saltc">Salt Creek</geogName>; at night reached <placeName
                        key="zanev">Zanes-<lb/>ville</placeName>, and lodged at <persName
                        key="minti1">M'Intire</persName>'s tavern. This is<lb/> a town lately laid
                    out on the <geogName key="muskr">Muskingum river</geogName>,<lb/> opposite to
                    the junction of <geogName key="lickc">Licking creek</geogName>. Its<lb/>
                    situation is very level and handsome, and will<lb/> doubtless command the trade
                    of this new coun-<lb/>try. As we approached the <geogName key="muskr"
                        >Muskingum</geogName>, our road<lb/>led us upon a hill of about 200 feet
                    elevation,<lb/> upon which we rode for a distance of seven<lb/> miles; both upon
                    our right and left hand, were<lb/> chains of hills about ten miles from us,
                        in<lb/><pb n="25"/> view, bearing the same westerly direction, with<lb/>
                    that upon which we travelled. The appearance<lb/>of these hills revived the
                    recollection of the<lb/><geogName key="bluerm">Blue Ridge</geogName>, and its
                    parallel mountians. Several<lb/> mounds or burial places were to-day

                <p>This day we travelled thirty miles and<lb/> lodged at a small hut called

                <p>We ferried the beautiful <geogName key="muskr">river Muskingum</geogName> at<lb/>
                    <placeName key="zanev">Zanesville</placeName>, where it is about 600 feet wide,
                    rode<lb/> through a tolerable tract of land, till we reached<lb/> a creek called
                        <geogName key="jonac">Jonathan's creek</geogName>. From this<lb/> creek to
                    the end of this day's journey, a distance<lb/> of twenty miles, we rode through
                    land which we<lb/> think preferable to any tract we have yet passed,<lb/> being
                    more level, the timber heavier and the soil<lb/> very rich; many Germans are
                    making settlements<lb/> here. Several mounds fell under our observa-<lb/>tion
                    to-day; we also saw many deer; seventeen<lb/> of these were together in one

                <p>Rode thirty-two miles, and at night<lb/> were permitted to lodge under a roof
                    called<lb/> Gray's. We passed through <placeName key="newlan">New
                        Lancaster</placeName>, a<lb/> town lately laid out, and situated on the
                        great<lb/><geogName key="hockhr">Hock-hocking river</geogName>, as it is
                    called upon the<lb/> maps. Its size greatly disappointed me; an ac-<lb/>tive man
                    may jump from one of its banks to the<lb/> other at <placeName key="newlan">New

                <p>This town as well as the neighboring country,<lb/> is being rapidly settled by
                    Germans. During<lb/><pb n="26"/> our day's ride, the extraordinary beauty of
                    the<lb/> country, as well as the superior excellency of the<lb/> land, excited
                    our admiration. Now and then a<lb/> prairie or natural meadow containing from
                    fifty<lb/> to two hundred acres, apparently a perfect level,<lb/> having neither
                    tree, shrub, stump, or stone, and<lb/> the soil the deepest black I ever saw in
                    any com-<lb/>position of earths, attracted our notice. These<lb/> were
                    surrounded by higher ground, covered with<lb/> lofty timber, extending to the
                    next prairie, and<lb/> thus on till we reached a tract called the <geogName
                        key="piquap">Piqua<lb/> Plains</geogName>. Here our admiration was afresh
                    excited<lb/> by a view of the most beautiful scenery we had<lb/> yet met with.
                    This tract is perfectly level; it is<lb/> situated upon the <geogName
                        key="sciot">Scioto river</geogName>, is seven miles in<lb/> length, and

                    composed<lb/> of the black earth above described; it is in part<lb/> under
                    cultivation. About the centre of the<lb/> prairie is a circular mound of large
                    diameter,<lb/> and about forty feet in height, cast up by art.<lb/> It is
                    covered with lofty timber. The people<lb/> who cultivate these plains find them
                    to produce<lb/> from eighty to one hundred bushels of Indian<lb/> corn, and from
                    forty to fifty bushels of Indian<lb/> corn, and from forty to fifty bushels of
                    wheat<lb/> per acre. They plant corn at the distance of<lb/> two and a half to
                    three feet apart, having six to<lb/> eight stalks in a hill.</p>
                <p>In the course of this day's journey we have<lb/> seen deer and turkeys in
                    abundance, and for<lb/><pb n="27"/> several days past have seen vast numbers

                <p>It is remarkable that there are uniformly<lb/> three gradations of elevation,

                    Then upon another elevation<lb/> of about fifteen feet, a second bottom, which

                    an-<lb/>other elevation about the same height, which ex-<lb/>tends for many

                    and<lb/> thirty feet in height, and is a globular figure of<lb/> great

                    our<lb/> way we passed many mounds. Several of them<lb/><pb n="30"/> were of the

                    to<lb/> it we found it to be a very extensive fortifica-<lb/>tion. It is

                <p>The bank which is cast up for the fortification<lb/> is now fully four feet in
                    height, and thirty-three<lb/> in width, at the base covered with lofty
                    timber.</p>
                <p>The figure marked (A) is a very regular oval<lb/> mound 500 feet in diameter,
                    from one extremity<lb/> to another the longest way, and 300 feet in<lb/>
                    diameter the other way; perpendicular height is<lb/> about thirty feet. This
                    mound is paved over<lb/> with stone, and has upon it trees of large size,
                    as<lb/> well as the remains of decaying trees, which<lb/> after acquiring their
                    full growth have fallen.<lb/> The two circles marked (B) are very perfect<lb/>
                    globular figures. They are one hundred feet in<lb/> diameter, and about thrity
                    feet perpendicular<lb/> height.</p>
                <p>The remaining eight small circles represent<lb/> mounds which are from eighty to
                    one hundred feet<lb/> in diameter, and from twenty-five to thirty feet<lb/>
                    perpendicular height, being also globular figures,<lb/> and all covered with
                    lofty timber. The semi-<lb/>circle (C) is a bank of earth thrown up to the<lb/>
                    height of about three feet, its diameter about<lb/> one hundred and fifty
                    feet.</p>
                <p>Near the outer banks of this extraordinary<lb/> fortification are many large
                    holes in the earth,<lb/> at least one hundred feet in diameter, and of<lb/>
                    considerable depth. These are no doubt places<lb/> out of which the earth was in
                    part taken for<lb/> making this work of labor.</p>
                <p>The land through which we have passed to-<lb/>day, is a continuation of a
                    country, very level <lb/><pb n="32"/> and beautiful, being situated on <geogName
                        key="paintc">Paint Creek</geogName>;<lb/> the soil, the same in appearance
                    as that de-<lb/>scribed yesterday, nothing seeming to indicate<lb/> its superior
                    richness, unless it be the size of its<lb/> timber. The heaviest and most
                    towering trees<lb/> we have seen, we met with to-day. Our progress<lb/> was
                    impeded by our curiosity to take the girth<lb/> of many trees; we measured white
                    oaks<lb/> which were from seven to eight feet in diameter;<lb/> walnuts, six to
                    seven feet four inches; elms, six<lb/> to six feet eight inches; ash, five feet,
                    and<lb/> honey locusts four feet in diameter; the girths<lb/> taken eight feet
                    above the surface of the earth.<lb/> These trees carried their thickness to an
                    amazing<lb/>height.</p>
                <p>We also measured a few sycamore trees, and<lb/> most of them were from eight to
                    ten feet in<lb/> diameter; one of the sycamores we measured<lb/> which was eight
                    feet in diameter, continued its<lb/> thickness forty-five feet without a limb,
                    its top<lb/> very branching and large. While we were admir-<lb/>ing it,
                        <persName key="pdenn1">Philip Dennis</persName>* suggested an opinion<lb/>
                    that this tree, could it be split into cord-wood<lb/> after the common manner,
                    would measure forty<lb/> cords. At first we questioned the statement,<lb/> but
                    upon making a calculation, became con-<lb/>vinced that his estimate was within
                    bounds. </p>
                <p>These were not trees singled out as the only<lb/> monuments; we turned not aside
                    to search for<lb/> them, but measured such as fell under our own<lb/>observation
                    in passing over our road. It is more<lb/><pb n="33"/> than probable that there
                    are trees in the same<lb/> tract larger than any we saw. Few settlements<lb/>
                    are yet made here. </p>

                <p>Rode seventeen miles, and reached the<lb/> residence of our friend <persName

                        <geogName key="paintc">Paint<lb/> Creek</geogName>; passing a great part of
                    the way through<lb/> the bottoms of <geogName key="paintc">Paint
                        Creek</geogName>. The land the same<lb/> in appearance as remarked
                    yesterday. In the<lb/> course of our ride, we saw many hundreds of<lb/> poplars
                    which were the more observable, as we<lb/> have scarcely noticed a poplar since
                    we crossed<lb/> the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>. These trees are
                    generally seven to<lb/> eight feet six inches in diameter, many of them<lb/>
                    continuing their thickness for fifty feet in height,<lb/> and very handsome and
                    sound. On the bot-<lb/>toms we saw deer in abundance; they were<lb/> so gentle
                    as to allow us to pass by them<lb/> quite within gun shot. They appeared to
                    be<lb/> busy in cropping the young grass. We have<lb/> also observed several
                    mounds and fortifications<lb/> near the falls to <geogName key="paintc">Paint
                        Creek</geogName>, and others nearly<lb/> adjacent of which the banks are
                    about three and<lb/> a half feet high.</p>
                <p>Upon this <geogName key="paintc">Creek</geogName> there are many beaver<lb/>
                    dams, and beavers are still caught here by the<lb/> Indians. For several days
                    past we have seen<lb/> many hunting camps but no Indians. Several<lb/> families
                    of Friends have settled in this remote<lb/> quarter of the Western Territory.
                    They have<lb/><pb n="34"/>removed from <placeName key="virgi"
                        >Virginia</placeName> and <placeName key="ncaro">North Carolina</placeName>,
                    and<lb/> expect to be followed by others. They tell us<lb/> that an indulged
                    meeting is held in one of their<lb/> houses.</p>
                <p>There is much to induce Friends of the South-<lb/>ern States, to remove to this
                    new country; for,<lb/> added to the consideration of the superior quality<lb/>
                    of the land, and the cheap and easy terms upon<lb/> which it is to be purchased,
                    there is an invalu-<lb/>able regulation in the Constitution of <placeName
                        key="ohio">Ohio</placeName>, pro-<lb/>hibiting the introduction of slaves.
                    The Con-<lb/>stitution has also provided that no person with-<lb/>in the State
                    shall voluntarily relinquish his right<lb/> to freedom. Its framers have even
                    gone further;<lb/> they declare that they have made these regula-<lb/>tions to
                    be binding both upon them and upon<lb/>their posterity.</p>
                <p>This truly valuable country is forbidden ground<lb/> to the <placeName
                        key="virgi">Virginia</placeName> slave holders. Many of them<lb/> have
                    approached as near to its borders as they<lb/> have dared, by settling along the
                    east shore of<lb/> the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio river</geogName>; their
                    murmurs induced several<lb/> persons in the State of <placeName key="ohio"

                    obtaining an alteration in this part of the<lb/> Constitution. We are told that
                    on account of<lb/> this avowal, they met with the most pointed and<lb/> zealous
                    opposition; the people declaring gene-<lb/>rally, that one of the inducements
                    which led<lb/> them to emigrate to the State, was the Constitu-<lb/><pb n="35"

                    with lofty timber, and<lb/> the soil very rich, scarcely a settlement yet<lb/>
                    made.</p>

                <p>Continued our journey, and after riding<lb/> fourteen miles, reached the house of
                        <persName key="slint1">Samuel<lb/> Linton</persName>, at <placeName
                        key="wains">Wainsville</placeName>, upon the <geogName key="littlemr">Little
                        Miami<lb/> river</geogName>, where we were kindly received. At this<lb/>
                    place we rested ourselves and horses, acquired<lb/> information respecting our
                    future route, and<lb/> equipped ourselves for the increasing difficulties<lb/>
                    of the wilderness.</p>
                <p>The settlement made here is composed cheifly<lb/> of Friends; about thirty
                    families reside in this<lb/> neighborhood. A Monthly Meeting is held<lb/> here
                    called <orgName key="miamm">Miami Monthly Meeting</orgName>, to which<lb/> about
                    thirty families more belong who are scat-<lb/>tered over an extensive tract of
                    country.</p>
                <p>Our attention was attracted to-day by the ap-<lb/>pearance of the stone, not only
                    in the beds of<lb/><pb n="37"/> the rivers and creeks, but also upon the
                    hills<lb/> and in the valleys. They are limestone, and are<lb/> composed
                    altogether of marine shells. The stone<lb/> when broken discovers the size and
                    shape of the<lb/>shells very perfectly.</p>
                <p>These shells are of the same description with<lb/> those I have formerly obtained
                    from the banks<lb/> of the <geogName key="chesab">Chesapeake Bay</geogName>, in
                    the lower part of the<lb/> State of <placeName key="maryl">Maryland</placeName>.
                    It may be remarked, that<lb/> no shell-fish of this description are at present
                    to<lb/> be found in any of the waters of our Continent.</p>
                <p>The country west of the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio river</geogName> through<lb/>
                    which we have passed is a limestone country,<lb/> the very pebbles and even sand
                    in many places<lb/> are limestone.</p>
                <p>Heretofore I have omitted to mention that in<lb/> the neighborhood of <placeName
                        key="chill">Chilicothe</placeName>, we amused our-<lb/>selves with the
                    earths and stones, which were<lb/> dug out of the ground in sinking wells.
                    There<lb/> are several layers or strata of limestone, gravel,<lb/> and sand,
                    within a few feet of the surface of the<lb/> earth. Some of the stones contain
                    the above<lb/> description of marine shells, and in breaking<lb/> some of the
                    large gravel we found appearances<lb/> of the same shells. The stones as well as
                    the<lb/> gravel have evident marks of their having been<lb/> washed with water,
                    their shape inclining greatly<lb/> to rotundity.</p>

                        <placeName key="dayt">Dayton</placeName>, where<lb/> we lodged. This town is

                    here about one<lb/> hundred and sixty feet in width. We have<lb/> passed to day
                    the Ridge which divides the waters<lb/> of the <geogName key="littlemr"
                        >Little</geogName> and <geogName key="gmiam">Great Miami</geogName>, and

                    de-<lb/>scription. The land lies in waves of great regu-<lb/>larity, is crossed
                    with heavy towering timber,<lb/> and the soil inexhaustibly rich. At <placeName
                        key="dayt">Dayton</placeName><lb/> were two block houses, which were erected
                    by<lb/> the white men, as places of retreat and defence<lb/> against an attack
                    by the Indians.</p>

                    above its mouth.<lb/> The river derives its name from its swift current.<lb/> We
                    also crossed several streams belonging to the<lb/>

                <p>This day after riding fifteen miles, we<lb/> reached <placeName key="flino"
                        >Flinn's ordinary</placeName>, where we were disap-<lb/>pointed in finding
                    no feed for our horses. We<lb/> also received the information that there was
                    no<lb/> probability of our obtaining provision for them<lb/><pb n="39"/> short
                    of <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>; we therefore despatched<lb/> a
                    part of our company to a house we had passed<lb/> about four miles, in quest of
                    corn. They obtained<lb/> four bushels, and hired a man and horse to travel<lb/>
                    with us and bring the corn along. For many<lb/> days past our horses have
                    suffered for want of<lb/> hay, and being fed altogether upon corn they<lb/> have
                    lost their appetites.</p>
                <p>The face of the country in the course of this<lb/> day's short journey is a
                    continuation of beautiful<lb/> land; being level, and finely timbered. We<lb/>
                    passed through a handsome prairie containing<lb/> several hundred acres called
                    the Lower <geogName key="piquap">Piqua<lb/> Plain</geogName>, crossed <geogName
                        key="honeyc">Honey Creek</geogName> and <geogName key="lostc">Lost
                        Creek</geogName>,<lb/> two considerable streams of the <geogName key="gmiam"
                        >Great Miami</geogName>.</p>
                <p>Thus far in our route we have been favored<lb/>with respect to the waters, no
                    rain having fallen<lb/> lately to raise the creeks and rivers to a height<lb/>
                    sufficient to detain us. In fording some of the<lb/> streams we have thought
                    that even six inches<lb/> greater depth would take our horses off their
                    feet.<lb/> There is considerable danger in fording many of<lb/> the streams we
                    have passed, from the uneveness<lb/> of the stony bottoms of the rivers. The
                    beds of<lb/> the rivers are mostly limestone, and being worn<lb/> smooth by the
                    washing of the water, horses are apt<lb/> to fall. This was to-day the case with
                    my horse in<lb/> fording the <geogName key="miamr">Miami</geogName>, from which
                    accident I got<lb/> very wet. </p>
                <p>During our detention here this afternoon, we<lb/> observed a flock of birds
                    alighting from the trees,<lb/><pb n="40"/> different in appearance from any we
                    had seen.<lb/> Our landlord informed us they were parrots, and<lb/> that they
                    were common upon the <geogName key="gmiam">Great Miami</geogName>;<lb/> and to
                    gratify our curiosity he shot one. It was<lb/> about the size of a dove, and its
                    plumage resem-<lb/>bled the green parrot of South America, the<lb/> head red,
                    and the wings tipped with the same<lb/> color, the tail long and the bill and
                    tongue of<lb/> the same description as the chattering parrot.<lb/> As they
                    alighted from the trees, they made a<lb/> hoarse noise resembling the chattering
                    of the<lb/> common parrot.</p>
                <p>There is also a woodcock here resembling the<lb/> red headed woodcock of
                        <placeName key="maryl">Maryland</placeName>, except that<lb/> its head is
                    black and its bill ivory.</p>
                <p>At this place <persName key="gwayn1">General Wayne</persName> erected a<lb/>
                    fortification when on his march against the In-<lb/>dians, a part of which is
                    now standing. Our<lb/> landlord occupies one of the houses which was<lb/> at
                    that time built and enclosed within the stock-<lb/>ade. From the late period in
                    the day at which<lb/> our supply of corn arrived for the horses, we<lb/> have
                    concluded to remain at our quarters; the<lb/> landlord tells us we shall be
                    welcome to sleep<lb/> upon his floor, and has promised to make us a<lb/> good
                    fire to sleep by. </p>
                <p>This is a kind of lodgment to which we have<lb/> become well accustomed, having
                    heretofore in<lb/> our journey often had to wrap ourselves in our<lb/> blankets
                    and to lie upon floors, always observing<lb/> the necessary precaution of laying
                    our feet to the<lb/> fire; we have in no instance taken cold.</p>

                <p>This day rode fourteen miles, and on<lb/> our way passed a larger prairie than
                    the one we<lb/> saw yesterday, which is called the Upper <geogName key="piquap"
                        >Piqua<lb/> Plains</geogName>. We have also passed a body of land<lb/>
                    heavily timbered, but its very level situation<lb/> renders it not desirable.
                    Through this tract we<lb/> have found a very deep and miry road, and<lb/> have
                    regretted the neccesity of a slow movement.<lb/> Our hired man has to lead his
                    horse, the bag of<lb/> corn being too heavy for the horse to bear his<lb/>
                    weight also. We reached a place called Lora-<lb/>mier's store, where we found a
                    shelter and<lb/> lodged, having through the latter part of the<lb/> day rode
                    through rain. On our way we twice<lb/> crossed a considerable water of the
                        <geogName key="miamr">Miami</geogName> called<lb/>
                    <geogName key="lorac">Loramier's Creek</geogName>.</p>
                <p>At this place there is a very large fortification<lb/> made by <persName
                        key="gwayn1">General Wayne</persName> called <placeName key="floram">Fort
                        Loramier</placeName>.<lb/> And here it is that the line of division
                    between<lb/> the white people and the Indians passes agree-<lb/>ably to the
                    treaty of peace* <note rend="asterisk">*Treaty of Greenville, for which see

                        Wayne</persName>. I may here remark that<lb/> for many days in passing
                    along, we have ob-<lb/>served hunting camps erected by the Indians,<lb/> but no
                    Indians in them.</p>
                <p>It is probable they are at present at or near<lb/> their towns. We have observed
                    from day to<lb/> day many curious, and to us unitelligible In-<lb/>dian
                    hieroglyphics cut upon the trees. We have<lb/> also been entertained in
                    examining these figures,<lb/> sometimes cut, at other times painted on the
                        <lb/><pb n="42"/>wood after cutting away the bark, the figures of<lb/> elks,
                    the horns of the elk, the figures of buffaloes,<lb/> bears, wolves, deer,
                    raccoons, and various other<lb/> wild beasts, and birds of different species;
                    turtles<lb/> and reptile creatures; also the representation of<lb/> men, women
                    and children, boys with bows and<lb/> arrows shooting game, and men with
                    their<lb/> guns aiming at game, or in the act of pursuing<lb/> it, &amp;c.
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>As a testimony in favor of the virtue and<lb/> modesty of these men of the woods,
                    I note, that<lb/> we have not yet observed amongst this variety<lb/> of figures,
                    one unchaste representation.</p>

                <p>Rode twenty-two miles through a flat<lb/> country, heavily timbered; at night we
                    encamped<lb/> in the woods, made a large fire, fared sumptu-<lb/>ously upon wild
                    pigeons, wrapped ourselves in<lb/> our blankets and slept soundly. Our
                    pigeons<lb/> were shot by one of our company who carries a<lb/> gun. There are
                    at this time vast numbers of<lb/> this fowl scattered over the woods. They
                    breed<lb/> here undisturbedly. Squirrels are also very<lb/> numerous. We now and
                    then see a few deer.<lb/> They are not plenty here. Wolves, opossums,<lb/>
                    reaccoons, and some other descriptions of wild<lb/> game are abundant. We have
                    not yet seen a<lb/> bear, though they are very plenty throughout<lb/> the region
                    we have passed over. This is owing<lb/> to a remarkable fact in the history of
                    this crea-<lb/>ture. They betake themselves to dens in the<lb/> holes of trees,
                    at an early period of the winter,<lb/><pb n="43"/> where they remain till the
                        <date when="1804-04-01">1st of the 4th month</date>.<lb/> During this
                    interval they never leave their holes,<lb/> and as they lay up no store for the
                    winter sup-<lb/>ply, it is certain they live without eating. The<lb/> Indians
                    say they live by sucking their paws.<lb/> The means by which their lives are
                    supported<lb/> in their recluse situation, I shall not undertake<lb/> to
                    determine. I shall however observe that when<lb/> taken from their dens they are
                    always very fat.<lb/> We have met with much of their meat, and can<lb/> assert
                    that we have seen the thickness of four<lb/> inches of fat between the skin and
                    the lean which<lb/> covers the ribs. During the winter the Indians<lb/> find the
                    bears by searching for their dens in the<lb/> trees, which they know by the
                    marks made by<lb/> the claws of the bear in climbing.</p>
                <p>We have now reached the waters of the lakes,<lb/> having to day forded one of the
                    forks of the <geogName key="stmar">St.<lb/> Mary's river</geogName>. On our way
                    we passed for a few<lb/> miles along a road one hundred feet wide, cut<lb/> by
                        <persName key="gwayn1">General Wayne's</persName> army for transporting
                    pro-<lb/>visions from the <geogName key="gmiam">great Miami</geogName> to the

                    grown up with briars<lb/> and shrubs.</p>
                <p>Shortly after we had made our fire, and with<lb/> the approach of night we heard
                    at a short dis-<lb/>tance from us, a whooping in the woods. We<lb/> had reason
                    to believe from the shrill and uncom-<lb/>mon whoop, that it was the voice of an
                    Indian,<lb/> and having understood that it was a custom<lb/> among them when
                    about to approach a camp, to<lb/><pb n="44"/> give notice by a whoop, we failed
                    not to return<lb/> the ceremony also by a whoop. In a few mo-<lb/>ments two
                    Indian men upon a horse, followed by<lb/> two women and a girl upon another
                    horse, rode<lb/> up to our camp. Their countenances were smil-<lb/>ing and
                    indicative of friendship. As we reached<lb/> them our hands, they shook them
                    saying, <said who="undetermined"><foreign xml:lang="del">Saga,<lb/> Saga,

                    ap-<lb/>paratus with them, and pointing several times<lb/> to the south, we
                    concluded they wished to make<lb/> us understand that their camp was in that
                    direc-<lb/>tion, and that they were on their way to it.<lb/> After looking upon
                    us for some minutes they<lb/> left us.</p>

                <p>Very early this morning we again pro-<lb/>ceeded, and this day rode thirty miles,
                    a laborious,<lb/> fatiguing journey to ourselves and horses. Our<lb/> path
                    leading through a flat country we find the<lb/> travelling miry and deep. Our
                    horses are to be<lb/> pitied, the stock of corn we procured for them<lb/> is
                    exhausted, and the only food they can<lb/> now get is the grass in the woods.
                    For several<lb/> nights past we have turned them loose to graze.<lb/> These poor
                    creatures feed around our camps and<lb/> appear afraid to leave us.</p>
                <p>This day we crossed the <geogName key="stmar">St. Mary's</geogName> where
                        its<lb/><pb n="45"/> width was about one hundred and fifty feet, it is<lb/>
                    said to be a very deep river. An old Indian<lb/> and his squaw reside here, and
                    he undertook to<lb/> ferry us across in a canoe. Our horses swam<lb/> the river,
                    and got over well. The old Indian,<lb/> whose name is <persName key="steph1"
                        >Stephen</persName>, very unintentionally<lb/> swam also. This accident was
                    owing to the mis-<lb/>conduct of some of the packers, who, on their<lb/> way to
                        <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName> with provisions, gave
                        <persName key="steph1">Stephen</persName><lb/> too much whisky. <persName
                        key="pdenn1">Philip Dennis</persName> was in the<lb/> canoe with him when he
                    accidentely fell over-<lb/>board; we were greatly alarmed for his safety,<lb/>
                    knowing that he was intoxicated, but after dis-<lb/>appearing for a few seconds,
                    he rose to the sur-<lb/>face of the water, and soon convinced us that he<lb/>
                    could swim. <persName key="pdenn1">Philip</persName> caught him by his
                    blanket,<lb/> and got him again into the boat. The old man<lb/> laughed very
                    heartily at the accident, saying to<lb/> us in broken English, <said
                        who="steph1">No fear, me ferry you<lb/> in de canoe yet.</said> Our
                    blacksmith having in-<lb/>formed <persName key="steph1">Stephen</persName> of
                    his expectation of settling in<lb/> the Indian country for the benefit of the
                    red<lb/> people, and the old man finding also that our<lb/> company were all
                    prosecuting their travels for<lb/> benevolent purposes, exercised his gratitude
                    by<lb/> telling us <said who="steph1">You pay one quarter dollar de man;<lb/>
                        nobody keep canoe here but <persName key="steph1">Stephen</persName>; he
                        make<lb/> the white people pay dollar, I make dem packers<lb/> pay me de
                        rest.</said> In <persName key="steph1">Stephen's</persName> hut we
                    observed<lb/> several Indians who were asleep. He says they<lb/> are Indians who
                    have come a great distance and<lb/><pb n="46"/> are tired. During the greater
                    part of this day<lb/> we have rode through a heavy rain. The rain<lb/>
                    continuing with the approach of night, we made<lb/> a large fire, and erected a
                    shelter in imitation of<lb/> the Indian hunting camps, covering it with our<lb/>
                    blankets. Under this we slept, and were but<lb/> little incommoded,
                    notwithstanding the rain<lb/> continued during the greater part of the
                    night.</p>
                <p>I must not omit to mention that we to-day<lb/> passed through a very level plain
                    containing<lb/> many thousand acres. This plain is almost with-<lb/>out trees.
                    The soil nearly hid by weeds and<lb/> grass of last year's growth; the
                    luxuriance of<lb/> which plainly demonstrates its extraordinary fer-<lb/>tility.
                    In this plain we observed a small pond<lb/> or lake in which were wild geese and
                    ducks in<lb/> abundance. We are informed that this is one<lb/> of the places
                    where wild fowl raise their young.</p>

                <p>Pursued our path and travelled twenty-<lb/>three miles through a very fertile,
                    heavily tim-<lb/>bered and beautiful country, being a little more<lb/> inclined
                    to hills. The ride to-day has been a<lb/> pleasing one, in part doubtless from
                    the reflec-<lb/>tion that the day would probably close a long,<lb/> tedious and
                    arduous journey. We at last reached<lb/><placeName key="fwayn">Fort

                        >Fort</placeName>,<lb/> having reached it within about thirty rods, we<lb/>
                    were saluted by a sentinel with the word <said who="undetermined"
                    >Halt.</said><lb/> We obeyed the command. A sergeant was de-<lb/>spatched from
                    the commanding officer, who en-<lb/>quired of us on his behalf, <said

                    business.</p>
                <p>The officer shortly returned to us with an in-<lb/>vitation to advance; we

                    defeat by which several hundred<lb/> of his men fell. Their bones lie scattered

                    the army made an escape<lb/> can be readily traced for the distance of five

                    busied with their several occupations. After<lb/>breakfast we paid a visit to

                    several hours with returned<lb/> to our quarters. In the afternoon we
                    observed<lb/> three Indians advancing toward our lodgings,<lb/> and soon
                    discovered that one of them was the<lb/><persName key="fmeda1">Five

                    the only information he had ob-<lb/>tained was that some Quakers had come.
                    Busi-<lb/>ness had brought him to the fort. They were<lb/> invited into our
                    room, when the chief instantly<lb/> recognized us both. He appeared glad to
                    see<lb/> us, and shook hands with both of us very hearti<lb/>ly. A person being
                    present who understood the<lb/><orgName key="potaw">Pottowattamy</orgName>

                    can-<lb/>didly replied to our inquiry after his health as<lb/> follows: <said
                        who="fmeda1">That in the course of last fall he went<lb/> to <placeName
                            key="detro">Detroit</placeName>, that whilst there the white people<lb/>
                        made him drink whiskey. That after he had<lb/> accomplished his business
                        there, he set out for<lb/> his home, and got upon his horse whilst the<lb/>
                        whiskey was in his head. That he had not rode<lb/> far before he fell from
                        his horse, and was very<lb/> much hurt by the fall, and that ever since
                        that<lb/> time he had not been well.</said></p>
                <p>After some further mutual inquiries, relative<lb/> to the welfare of red and
                    white acquaintance, we<lb/> we informed him through an interpreter that we<lb/>
                    had come to see our red brethren, that we had<lb/> messages for both the
                        <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> and himself,<lb/> and were
                    glad that it had so happened that we<lb/> had come. That we hoped the <persName

                    wished to<lb/> see them together, having something to say to<lb/> them. He
                    appeared pleased with this informa-<lb/>tion, and expressed that he had made a
                    camp<lb/> not far off, where he would wait for the arrival<lb/> of the <persName

                    wilderness.<lb/> Having answered his questions, he replied in<lb/> turn to our
                    inquiries as follows: That since he<lb/> saw us it had pleased the Great Spirit
                    to take<lb/> away two of his brothers and a nephew. That<lb/> his nephew was the
                        <persName key="toad1">Toad</persName>, a young chief who<lb/> was with him
                    in <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>. That he died on<lb/> his
                    return from that visit, and within a few miles<lb/> of home, of which
                    circumstances he had desired<lb/><persName key="wwell1">William Wells</persName>
                    to inform us. That with respect<lb/> to himself, he was but half well, having
                    been<lb/> very sick last fall and expected to die. That<lb/> his white brothers
                    at <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>, hearing of<lb/> his illness,
                    sent a doctor to him who gave him<lb/> physic and made him better. That he had
                    now<lb/> seen fifty-three winters, and two of his brothers<lb/> being dead, made
                    him think of death, and that<lb/> his time would soon come.</p>
                <p>He also told us that he had left a brother at<lb/> his town who would have
                    accompanied him,<lb/> being desirous to come with him, but could<lb/> not find
                    his horse in time. After this, other<lb/> conversation took place of a general
                    nature. The<lb/> interpreter informs us that his complaint is the<lb/>
                    <pb n="54"/> gout, and that in the time of his illness he (the<lb/> interpreter)
                    had told him that his complaint be-<lb/>longed to great folks and gentlemen.

                <p>About 2 o'clock we dined. At the head of the<lb/> table sat the interpreter's

                    a distinguished chief. She had prepared for<lb/> us a large well roasted wild

                        <p>Brothers and Friends.- You observe that<lb/> the letter which has just
                            been read, makes men-<lb/>tion of four of us appointed to visit you.
                            One<lb/> of these was an infirm man who thought he<lb/> could not endure
                            the fatigue of so long a jour-<lb/>ney, and therefore did not come. The
                            other<lb/> did not omit to come for the want of love to his<lb/> red
                            brethren; family circumstances rendered it<lb/> inconvenient for him to
                            leave home. You see,<lb/><pb n="57"/> brothers, that it has pleased the
                            Great Spirit<lb/> that two of us mentioned in the letter, should<lb/>
                            reach the country of our red brethren. Brothers,<lb/> we thought it
                            right in the first place to send for<lb/> you, and to show you the
                            letter which has just<lb/> been read. We are glad that you are now
                            come,<lb/> and that we have this opportunity of taking you<lb/> by the
                            hand.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we believe that we have some things<lb/> to say to you which
                            are of great importance to<lb/> our red brothers, to their old men, to
                            their young<lb/> men, to their women, and to their children.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we may now mention that we have<lb/> not come merely to talk,
                            but we hope we have<lb/> come prepared to do a little for the welfare
                            of<lb/> our red brethren.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, in looking over our business, we<lb/> have thought that we
                            should be glad to have an<lb/> opportunity of seeing our red brethren
                            together,<lb/> and are willing to propose for your consideration,<lb/>
                            that you should now fix upon some place, and<lb/> agree upon some time
                            to meet us again, and that<lb/> our brothers invite their old men, their
                            young<lb/> men, their women and their children to meet us,<lb/> when we
                            shall have something to say which it<lb/> may not be necessary now to
                            say.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends,- Should you think<lb/> that the proposal which we
                            have now made is<lb/> proper, and conclude to meet us in the manner<lb/>
                            we have pointed out, we expect we shall have<lb/> but little more to say
                            at present.</p>

                <p>Here a pause <lb/><pb n="58"/> for some minutes took place, when the <persName
                        key="lturt1">Little<lb/> Turtle</persName> inquired, <said who="lturt1">If
                        the Friends had more to<lb/> say.</said> He was answered in the
                    negative.</p>
                <p>After a further pause and some conversation<lb/> between the two chiefs, they
                    rose from their<lb/> seats, and perceiving that they were advancing<lb/> toward
                    us, we also arose from our seats. On meet-<lb/>ing them, they took us by the
                    hand, and with<lb/> countenances indicative of great gravity, shook<lb/> hands
                    with us and returned to their seats.</p>
                <p>The <persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> then commenced a speech<lb/> as
                    follows:-</p>
                <floatingText>
                    <body>
                        <dateline><date when="1804-04-02"/><placeName key="fwayn"/></dateline>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends: My friend, the <persName key="lturt1">Lit-<lb/>tle
                                Turtle</persName>, and myself, together with my two<lb/> sons, who
                            are present, rejoice to have this oppor-<lb/>tunity of seeing you, and
                            of taking you by the<lb/> hand.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers: We are glad to be informed,<lb/> that you received our talk
                            sent to you last fall,<lb/> and to find that you are now come to the
                            country<lb/> of your red brethren.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends: We rejoice that<lb/> the Great Spirit has
                            conducted you safely to our<lb/> country, and figure to ourselves that
                            in you we<lb/> see the rest of our brothers and friends of <placeName
                                key="balti1">Balti-<lb/>more</placeName>, and that in taking you by
                            the hand, we<lb/> take them by the hand.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We know that you have come a<lb/> long distance to see the
                            situation of your red<lb/> brethren. We have no doubt that you have<lb/>
                            things to say which are of great importance to<lb/>
                            <pb n="59"/>us, and which do not belong to a few only but<lb/> to many. </p>
                        <p>Brothers: Your brethren the Indians do<lb/> business not as the white
                            people do. We con-<lb/>vene our chiefs, and things of importance
                            are<lb/> considered by them. But, brothers, you have<lb/> come to see
                            the situation of your red brethren.<lb/> It is our wish that you should
                            see it. You shall<lb/> not be disappointed. The proposal you have<lb/>
                            made to us we think right, and have concluded<lb/> that this place
                                (<placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>,) is the best
                            place<lb/> to be fixed upon for the purpose you wish. We<lb/> are
                            pleased to find that you have a desire that<lb/> our young men should be
                            present to hear what<lb/> you have to say, and as it is your wish to see
                            our<lb/> women and children, we desire that you may<lb/> have an
                            opportunity of seeing them.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends: Our young men are<lb/> out hunting, and our women
                            and children are<lb/> now at work at their sugar camps. The time is<lb/>
                            not far off when they will all return to our<lb/> towns, when it is
                            usual to meet together. We<lb/> hope, brothers, that you will not be in
                            a hurry,<lb/> but will allow us time to collect our people
                            to-<lb/>gether.</p>

                <p>Here a pause took place, when we inquired if<lb/> they had any thing further to
                    add. And being<lb/> answered in the negative, we addressed them<lb/> again in
                    substance as follows:</p>
                <floatingText>
                    <body>

                        <p>Brothers and Friends: When we left our <lb/><pb n="60"/> homes, we knew
                            it was early in the season, and<lb/> expected that we should ge to the
                            country of<lb/> our red brethren at a time when their young<lb/> men,
                            their women and children would be busy.<lb/> But brothers, a part of the

                            required that we should<lb/> come early, and makes it also necessary
                            that we<lb/> should now be in a hurry.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We will also add that when we<lb/> were chosen by our friends
                            at home to pay a<lb/> visit to our red brethren, our women and
                            chil-<lb/>dren consented that we should leave them, but<lb/> charged us
                            that we should not stay away from<lb/> them longer than circumstances
                            really required.<lb/> A long time has already past since we left
                            them,<lb/> we therefore hope, brothers, that in three or four<lb/> days
                            it will be in your power to get together<lb/> some of your people. Those
                            that are far from<lb/> home we do not wish that you should send for.</p>
                    </body>
                </floatingText>
                <p>The <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> then observed that the
                    res-<lb/>sons we had given were good. The <persName key="fmeda1">Five
                        Medals</persName><lb/> next remarked that at the time proposed, they<lb/>
                    could easily convene a considerable number of<lb/> their indolent people, who
                    were too lazy to hunt<lb/> or make sugar, but such they did not wish us to<lb/>
                    see. Their industrious young men and women <lb/>
                    <pb n="61"/>were too far from home to be convened in so<lb/> short a time.</p>
                <p>Here a short conversation took place between<lb/> the chiefs, and afterwards they
                    proposed seven<lb/> day's hence as the time; desiring that to-morrow<lb/> might
                    not be counted, as it would take them a<lb/> day to return home. To this we
                    consented.</p>
                <p>The <persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> then expressed as follows:</p>

                        <p>Brothers, it would have been very desirable<lb/> to us if you could have
                            met us at the time of our<lb/> counsel. We have very often told our
                            people<lb/> of the Quakers. They listen to us, but are at a<lb/> loss to
                            know what sort of people the Quakers<lb/> are. If you could stay,
                            brothers, they would<lb/> have an opportunity of seeing the Quakers,
                            and<lb/> of hearing words from your own mouths.</p>

                <p>After this the <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> added:</p>

                        <p>Brothers: We hope the words that you<lb/> may say to us at the time we
                            have appointed to<lb/> meet will be upon paper. From that paper we<lb/>
                            can at some future time have your words de-<lb/>livered to our people.
                            This, brothers, will in some<lb/> measure answer the end.</p>

                <p>During a pause which occupied several<lb/> minutes we asked them if we understood

                <p>After this we took each other by the hand<lb/> and very cordially bade farewell.
                    We then re-<lb/>turned to our lodgings.</p>
                <pb n="62"/>
                <p>In the evening we again had the company of<lb/> the chiefs, they having been

                    is<lb/> made from the sugar tree. This art has long<lb/> been known to the

                <p>Spent the day with <persName key="wwell1">Captain<lb/> Wells</persName>. We
                    walked with him up the <geogName key="stjos">St. Joseph's<lb/> river</geogName>,
                    and were shown the ground upon which<lb/> the Indians under the command of the
                        <persName key="lturt1">Little<lb/> Turtle</persName> defeated a part of the
                    United States army<lb/> under <persName key="jharm1">General Harmar</persName>,
                    killing 300 out 500<lb/> men. We also followed for a considerable dis-<lb/>tance
                    the route which the soldiers took in their<lb/> retreat, and saw many of their
                    bones. Amongst<lb/> these were skulls which had marks of the<lb/> tomahawk and
                    scalping knife. Many of them<lb/> had fallen on the east bank of the river,
                    and<lb/> also within the river. The Indians being sta-<lb/>tioned behind trees
                    on the west side shot them<lb/> in their attempt to get across.</p>
                <p>We were shown the tree behind which the<lb/><pb n="64"/>
                    <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName> took his station, as also a tree
                    near<lb/> it behind which <persName key="toad1">his nephew</persName> fell. This
                    was a<lb/> second defeat, the United States troops having<lb/> been routed the

                <p>Spent the day in the neighborhood of<lb/>
                    <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>, in the course of which we visited<lb/>
                    <persName key="awhip1">Captain Whipple</persName>. This afternoon several
                    In-<lb/>dians from different tribes arrived, bringing<lb/> with them skins and
                    furs. These are mostly<lb/> brought by the women upon their backs, the<lb/> men
                    thinking it sufficient to carry their guns<lb/> and hunting equipments.</p>
                <p>We saw this evening a white woman, who,<lb/> when a small girl, had been taken
                    captive, and<lb/> has ever since lived amongst the <orgName key="potaw"
                        >Pottowatamy<lb/> tribe</orgName> of Indians. She tells us (through an
                    in-<lb/>terpreter) that she has no knowledge of the<lb/> part of the country
                    from which she was taken,<lb/> nor of her family. That she remembers her
                    name<lb/> was Dolly, which is the only distinct recollec-<lb/>tion she retains
                    of herself previous to her cap-<lb/>tivity. This woman is dressed in Indian
                    habit,<lb/> is painted after the Indian order, and has so<lb/> effectually
                    adopted Indian manners, that a nice<lb/> observer would not discover from
                    external ob-<lb/>servation her origin, except from the color of<lb/> her eyes,
                    which are grey.</p>

                <p>Visited <persName key="wwell1">William Wells</persName>, and rode with<lb/> him
                    up the <geogName key="stmar">St. Mary's</geogName> about five miles. On<lb/> our
                    way we passed several sugar camps, at which<lb/> were Indian women and children
                    who were em-<lb/><pb n="65"/>ployed in making sugar. Their huts were large,<lb/>
                    and covered with the bark of the Buck Eye<lb/> wood. Their troughs for catching
                    the sugar<lb/> water as it is called, are made of the bark of the<lb/> red elm,
                    they are made thin, and the ends tied<lb/> together. We were shown the places
                    where<lb/> stood the houses of several distinguished char-<lb/>acters amongst
                    the Indians. <persName key="wwell1">Captain Wells</persName> also<lb/> took us
                    to the ground, where the <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName><lb/>
                    reviewed his men, and gave them their orders<lb/> before going against the army
                    of <persName key="gstcl1">General St.<lb/> Clair</persName>. It is an extensive
                    plain near the river.<lb/><persName key="wwell1">Wells</persName> was then one
                    of the number, and says the<lb/><persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>
                    had one thousand four hundred<lb/> men; <persName key="gstcl1">St.
                        Clair's</persName> army consisted of a much larger<lb/> number, and were
                    about fifty miles distant at<lb/> the time. The <persName key="lturt1">Little
                        Turtle</persName> divided his men<lb/> into bands or messes, to each mess
                    twenty men.<lb/> It was the business of four of this number alter-<lb/>nately to
                    hunt for provisions. At 12 o'clock<lb/> each day it was the duty of the hunters
                    to re-<lb/>turn to the army with what they had killed. By<lb/> this regulation,
                    his warriors were well supplied<lb/> with provisions, during the seven day's in
                    which<lb/> they were advancing from this place to the field<lb/> of battle. It
                    is well known that at day break<lb/> the Indians commenced an unexpected
                    attack<lb/> upon <persName key="gstcl1">St. Clair's</persName> forces, killed
                    nine hundred of<lb/> his men, and put his whole army to flight.<lb/><persName
                        key="wwell1">Wells</persName> says, that only about thirty Indians were<lb/>
                    killed in the battle, and that about twenty died <lb/><pb n="66"/> afterwards of
                    their wounds. He also related<lb/> the following anecdote:</p>
                <p>A considerable altercation arose amongst the<lb/> Indians on the review ground,
                    relative to a<lb/> Commander-in-Chief. Some were in favor of<lb/>
                    <persName key="buckon1">Buckangehelas</persName>, a principal chief amongst the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="delaware">Delawares</orgName>, whilst others were in favor of the<lb/>
                    <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>. At length <persName
                        key="buckon1">Buckangehelas</persName> himself<lb/> decided the controversy
                    by yielding to the <persName key="lturt1">Little<lb/> Turtle</persName>, saying
                    that he was the youngest and most<lb/> active man, and that he preferred him to
                    him-<lb/>self. This reconciled the parties, and the <persName key="lturt1"
                        >Little<lb/> Turtle</persName> took the command.</p>
                <p>We also rode to view a prairie which extends<lb/> from the <geogName key="stmar"
                        >St. Mary's river</geogName> to the <geogName key="little">Little
                        river</geogName>, a<lb/> branch of the <geogName key="wabas"
                        >Wabash</geogName>. The distance from one<lb/> to the other is not more than
                    four miles, and<lb/> the highest ground is not more than five feet<lb/> above
                    the water in either river. The Indians<lb/> say that in high freshets they have
                    passed from<lb/> one water to the other in their canoes. A canal<lb/> might
                    easily be cut here, and at a small expense,<lb/> by which the waters of the
                    lakes and the waters<lb/> of the <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName>, (and of
                    course the <geogName key="missi">Mississippi</geogName>)<lb/> would be
                    connected. An abundance of furs<lb/> and skins taken on the waters of the
                        <geogName key="ohior">Ohio</geogName> and<lb/> the <geogName key="wabas"
                        >Wabash</geogName>, are brought up the latter river in<lb/> boats by the
                    Canadians and the Indians, and<lb/> thence taken across a portage of eight miles
                    to<lb/> the <orgName key="miami">Miami</orgName> of the Lakes,* <note
                        rend="asterisk">*The <geogName key="maume">Maumee river</geogName>.</note>
                    whence they are<lb/>

                        >Detroit</placeName>; goods suit-<lb/>able for the Indian trade are also
                    transported<lb/> back again by the same route.</p>
                <p>After spending some time in viewing the re-<lb/>mains of several old Indian
                    towns, graves, hiero-<lb/>glyphics, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., we returned to
                        <persName key="wwell1">William<lb/> Wells</persName>' house, where we dined,
                    and in the even-<lb/>ing returned to our lodgings.</p>

                <p>Paid a visit to the carpenter and black-<lb/>smith who accompanied us as before
                    mentioned.<lb/> They are both at work. The blacksmith is re-<lb/>pairing Indian
                    guns, and the carpenter is at<lb/> work upon a council house which the
                    govern-<lb/>ment has ordered to be built for the Indians at<lb/> their request.
                    The house is to be built of hewn<lb/> logs, fifty feet in length, and
                    twenty-five in width.<lb/> We also amused ourselves in attending to the<lb/>
                    manner of packing furs and skins. Our friend<lb/> Jonathan has several Canadians
                    now employed<lb/> in that business. They are packed by a ma-<lb/>chine
                    constructed for the purpose, by which the<lb/> work is performed expeditiously.
                    The packs<lb/> are made in squares of about two and a half feet,<lb/> and
                    contain from thirty-five to forty deer skins,<lb/> or about two hundred raccoon

                <p>On the evening of this day, we received<lb/> a message from the <persName

                        and<lb/><persName>Simms</persName>, and several other reputable persons,
                    and<lb/> were met by the following chiefs:</p>
                <p><persName key="obass1">O-bas-se-a, (or the Fawn,)</persName> a village chief
                    of<lb/> great distinction in the <orgName key="miami">Miami</orgName>
                    nation.</p>
                <p><persName key="osso1">Os-so-mit</persName>, a village chief of the <orgName

                        >Miami</orgName> nation.</p>
                <p>They were attended by a considerable num-<lb/>ber of their principal young men,
                    and by several<lb/> women.</p>
                <p>The <persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> was not present. He had<lb/>
                    informed us on taking leave, that circumstances<lb/> required him to return to
                    his town, and that the<lb/> distance would be too great for him to return
                    in<lb/> time to meet us, his infirmities occasioning him<lb/> to travel slowly,
                    but that he would send his<lb/> brother, who would report to him faithfully
                    all<lb/> the proceedings of the council.</p>
                <p>After we had taken each other by the hand,<lb/> the chiefs took their seats by
                    the side of each<lb/> other. Their principal people next seated them-<lb/>selves
                    according to the rank or distinction which<lb/> they held. After them, their
                    young men in<lb/> circular order, seat after seat,- and lastly, the<lb/> women,-
                    who occupied seats separate from the<lb/> men, being placed near the centre of
                    the room.</p>
                <pb n="69"/>
                <p>We took our seats on the opposite side of the<lb/> house and in front of the
                    Indians.</p>
                <p>Being all thus seated- I speak literally, when<lb/> I say my heart palpitated- I
                    felt the importance<lb/> and dignity of our mission; I wished our heads<lb/>
                    were wiser, and feared for the result of so in-<lb/>teresting an
                    opportunity.</p>
                <p>After a few minutes had passed, the <persName key="lturt1">Little<lb/>

                    us of the difficulty there was in<lb/> convening the Indians at so early a
                    period in<lb/> the season, and that those of their people then<lb/> present with
                    him were all who were likely to<lb/> attend to listen to what we had to say.</p>
                <p>We then proposed that the letter from our<lb/> friends and brothers at home, read
                    to the <persName key="fmeda1">Five<lb/> Medals</persName> and the <persName

                <p>This proposal was deemed proper, and the<lb/> letter was accordingly read.</p>
                <p>After a short pause, we addressed them as<lb/> follows:</p>

                        <p>Brothers and Friends: When we were to-<lb/>gether, eight days ago, with
                            the <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName><lb/> and the
                                <persName key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName>, the letter was read
                            to<lb/> them, which has just been read. That letter,<lb/> you observe,
                            says that we were appointed by<lb/> the people called <orgName key="bym"
                                >Quakers, of <placeName key="balti1"
                            >Baltimore</placeName></orgName>, to visit<lb/> you, and to take you by
                            the hand on their be-<lb/>half, desiring that you would receive any
                            com-<lb/>munications from us, as coming immediately<lb/> from them.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: After that letter was read, our<lb/> hearts were filled with so
                            much love for our Red<lb/> Brethren, that, on looking over and
                            considering<lb/> the business upon which we had come, we felt<lb/> a
                            desire to see as many together as could be<lb/> convened- and this day
                            was that agreed upon<lb/> for us to meet you.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We believed that the things we<lb/> had to say were of great
                            importance to our Red<lb/> Brethren, and therefore it was that we
                            request-<lb/>ed to see you together, that you all might have<lb/> an
                            opportunity of hearing what we have to say.</p>
                        <pb n="71"/>
                        <p>Brothers: Our hearts are filled with thank-<lb/>fulness to the Great
                            Spirit, that He has<lb/> brought us safely to the country of our
                            Red<lb/> Brethren, and protected us through the journey.<lb/> We also
                            rejoice that He has given us this oppor-<lb/>tunity of seeing you, and
                            of taking you by the<lb/> hand.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: It is now a little more than two<lb/> years since your Brothers
                            of <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName> had an<lb/> opportunity
                            of becoming acquainted with the<lb/><persName key="fmeda1">Five
                                Medals</persName>, the <persName key="lturt1">Little
                                Turtle</persName>, <persName key="tuthi1">Tuthinipee</persName>,
                            and<lb/> some other chiefs. They were glad of that op-<lb/>portunity of
                            having a talk with them, and of<lb/> enquiring after the situation of
                            their Red<lb/> Brethren.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We had for some time entertain-<lb/>ed apprehensions, that the
                            many changes which<lb/> were taking place in circumstances, must
                            greatly<lb/> change the situation of our Red Brethren, and<lb/> that the
                            time was fast approaching, in which it<lb/> would be necessary for them
                            to alter their mode<lb/> of living.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: After our talk with the chiefs<lb/> whom we have just
                            mentioned, we were fully con-<lb/>vinced that the time was come, in
                            which our Red<lb/> Brethren ought to begin to cultivate their
                            lands;<lb/> that they ought to raise corn and other grain,<lb/> also
                            horses, cows, sheep, hogs, and other animals.<lb/> We then proposed to
                            afford them some assist-<lb/>ance. They appeared to be glad of the
                                proposal,<lb/><pb n="72"/> and informed that many of their people
                            were<lb/> disposed to turn heir attention to the cultiva-<lb/>tion of
                            the earth. They also expressed a desire<lb/> to be assisted by their
                            Brothers of <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: Having been encouraged by the<lb/> opportunity which we then
                            had, we sent to the<lb/> care of the Agent for Indian Affairs some
                            ploughs,<lb/> harness for horses, axes, hoes, and other imple-<lb/>ments
                            of husbandry, which were made for the<lb/> use of our Red Brethren, and
                            desired that they<lb/> might be distributed amongst them as tokens
                            of<lb/> our friendship.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We received last fall, through<lb/> the hands of the Agent for
                            Indian Affairs, a<lb/> talk from the <persName key="lturt1">Little
                                Turtle</persName>, the <persName key="fmeda1">Five
                            Medals</persName>,<lb/> and others, informing us that they had
                            received<lb/> the implements of husbandry, and requested<lb/> that their
                            Brothers of <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName> would
                            send<lb/> some of their people into the country of their<lb/> Red
                            Brethren for the purpose of seing their<lb/> situation, and showing them
                            how to make use of<lb/> the tools, saying they did not know how to<lb/>
                            begin. </p>
                        <p>Brothers: It is for these purposes that we<lb/> have now come; and we
                            again repeat, that we<lb/> rejoice we have the opportunity of seeing
                            you,<lb/> and of taking you by the hand.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: In coming into the country of our<lb/> Red Brethren, we have
                            come with our eyes open.<lb/> And although we are affected with sorrow,
                            in<lb/> believing that many of the Red Brethren suffer<lb/><pb n="73"/>
                            much for the want of food and for the want of<lb/> clothing, yet our
                            hearts have been made glad, in<lb/> seeing that it has pleased the Great
                            Spirit to<lb/> give you a rich and valuable country. Because<lb/> we
                            know that it is out of the earth that food<lb/> and clothing come. We
                            are sure, brothers, that<lb/> with but little labor and attention, you
                            may raise<lb/> much more corn and other grain than will be<lb/>
                            necessary for yourselves, your women and chil-<lb/>dren, and may also,
                            with great ease, raise many<lb/> more horses, cows, sheep, hogs and
                            other valuable<lb/> animals, than will be necessary for your own
                            use.<lb/> We are also confident, that if you will pursue<lb/> our method
                            in the cultivation of your land, you<lb/> will live in much greater ease
                            and plenty,<lb/> and<lb/> with much less fatigue and toil, than
                            attend<lb/> hunting, for a subsistence.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We are fully convinced, that if<lb/> you will adopt our mode of
                            cultivating the earth,<lb/> and of raising useful animals, you will find
                            it to<lb/> be a mode of living, not only far more plentiful<lb/> and
                            much less fatiguing, but also much more<lb/> certain, and which will
                            expose your bodies less<lb/> to the inclemencies of the weather than is
                            now<lb/> attendant upon hunting. It will lead you,<lb/> brothers, to
                            have fixed homes. You will build<lb/> comfortable dwelling-houses for
                            yourselves, your<lb/> women and children, where you may be
                            shelter-<lb/>ed from the rain, from the frost, and from the<lb/> snow,
                            and where you may enjoy in plenty the<lb/> rewards of your labors.</p>
                        <pb n="74"/>
                        <p>Brothers: In laying these things before<lb/> you, we have no other motive
                            than a desire of<lb/> heart for the improvement, the benefit and
                            the<lb/> welfare of our Red Brethren- and therefore it<lb/> is that we
                            speak with freedom, and we hope,<lb/> that what we have to say, will go
                            in at one ear,<lb/> and not come out the other, but that it will be<lb/>
                            remembered by our Red Brethren. For we<lb/> know, brothers, that we
                            shall not be ashamed of<lb/> what we say, when, in time to come, you
                            com-<lb/>pare the things we are saying to you with your<lb/> experience
                            in practising them.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We will here mention, that the<lb/> time was, when the
                            forefathers of your brothers,<lb/> the white people, lived beyond the
                            great water,<lb/> in the same manner that our Red Brethren now<lb/>
                            live. The winters can yet be counted when<lb/> they went almost naked,
                            when they procured their<lb/> living by fishing, and by the bow and
                            arrow in<lb/> hunting- and when they lived in houses no bet-<lb/>ter
                            than yours. They were encouraged by some<lb/> who came from the
                            sun-rising, and lived amongst<lb/> them, to change their mode of living.
                            They<lb/> did change- they cultivated the earth, and we<lb/> are sure
                            the change was a happy one.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends: We are not ashamed<lb/> to acknowledge that the
                            time was when our fore-<lb/>fathers rejoiced at finding a wild plumb
                            tree, or<lb/> at killing a little game, and that they wandered<lb/> up
                            and down, living on the uncertain supplies<lb/> of fishing and hunting.
                            But, brothers, for your <lb/><pb n="75"/> encouragement, we now mention
                            that, by turn-<lb/>ing their attention to the cultivation of the<lb/>
                            earth, instead of the plumb tree, they soon had<lb/> orchards of many
                            kinds of good fruits- instead<lb/> of wild game, they soon had large
                            numbers of<lb/> cattle, horses, sheep, hogs, and other valuable<lb/>
                            animals,- and in many places, instead of their<lb/> forests, they had
                            large fields of corn and other<lb/> grain, as also many other valuable
                            productions<lb/> of the earth.</p>
                        <p>Brothers: We hope your eyes will be open<lb/> to see clearly, the things
                            which are best for you,<lb/> and that you will desire to pursue them.
                            We<lb/> believe, brothers, that it is in the heart of your<lb/> father,
                            the President of the United States, to<lb/> assist his red children in
                            the cultivation of the<lb/> earth, and to render them services which
                            will be<lb/> greatly for their benefit and welfare. We hope<lb/> that
                            your exertions to change your present mode<lb/> of living will be so
                            plain to him, that he will<lb/> see them. This will encourage him to
                            continue<lb/> to aid you, in your endeavors.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we have spoken plainly; we de-<lb/>sire to speak plainly. We
                            will now tell you<lb/> that we have not come merely to talk to you.<lb/>
                            We have come prepared to render you a little<lb/> assistance. Our
                            beloved brother, <persName key="pdenn1">Philip Dennis</persName>,<lb/>
                            who is now present, has come along with us.<lb/> His desire is to
                            cultivate for you a field of corn;<lb/> also, to show you how to raise
                            some of the other<lb/> productions of the earth. He knows how to
                                use<lb/><pb n="76"/> the plough, the hoe, the axe, and other
                            imple-<lb/>ments of husbandry.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we here ask you, are you still de-<lb/>sirous to be instructed
                            by us, in the cultivation<lb/> of your lands? If you say you are, our
                            brother,<lb/> whom we have just mentioned, will continue<lb/> with you
                            during the summer. We shall leave<lb/> it to you to show him the spot
                            where to begin<lb/> to work.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, he has left a farm, he has left a<lb/> wife, and five small
                            children, who are very dear<lb/> to him; he has come from a sincere
                            desire to be<lb/> useful to our red brothers. His motives are<lb/> pure,
                            he will ask no reward from you, for his<lb/> services, his greatest
                            reward will be in the satis-<lb/>faction he will feel in finding you
                            inclined to<lb/> take hold of the same tools which he takes hold<lb/>
                            of, to receive from him instruction in the culti-<lb/>vation of your
                            lands, and to pursue the example<lb/> he will set you.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we hope you will make the situa-<lb/>tion of our brother as
                            comfortable as circum-<lb/>stances will admit. We hope, also, that
                            many<lb/> of your young men will be willing to be taught<lb/> by him, to
                            use the plough, the hoe, and other<lb/> implements of husbandry. For we
                            are sure,<lb/> brothers, that as you take hold of such tools as<lb/> are
                            in the hands of the white people, you will<lb/> find them to be to you
                            like having additional<lb/> hands. You will also find that by using
                                them,<lb/><pb n="77"/> they will enable you to do many things
                            which,<lb/> without them, cannot be performed.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, there is one thing more which we<lb/> wish to add. The white
                            people, in order to get<lb/> their land cultivated, find it necessary
                            that their<lb/> young men should be employed in it, and not<lb/> their
                            women. Women are less than men. They<lb/> are not as strong as men. They
                            are not as able<lb/> to endure fatigue as men. It is the business
                            of<lb/> our women to be employed in our houses, to<lb/> keep them clean,
                            to sew, to knit, spin, and<lb/> weave, to dress food for themselves and
                            families,<lb/> to make clothes for the men and the rest of their<lb/>
                            families, to keep the clothes of their families<lb/> clean, and to take
                            care of their children. </p>
                        <p>Brothers, we desire not to mention too many<lb/> things to you, but we
                            must add a little further.<lb/> We are fully convinced that if you will
                            turn your<lb/> attention to the cultivation of the earth, to
                            rais-<lb/>ing the different kinds of grain, to erecting mills<lb/> for
                            grinding grain, to building comfortable dwell-<lb/>ing houses for your
                            families, to raising useful<lb/> animals- amongst others, sheep, for the
                            advan-<lb/>tage of the wool, in making clothing- to raising<lb/> flax
                            and hemp for your linen; and your young<lb/> women learn to spin and
                            weave, that your lives<lb/> would be easier and happier than at
                            present,<lb/> and that your numbers will increase, and not<lb/> continue
                            to diminish. As we observed,<lb/> brothers, your land is good. It is far
                            better<lb/> than the land the white people near the great<lb/><pb n="78"
                            /> water cultivate. We are persuaded that your<lb/> land will produce
                            double the quantity of any<lb/> kind of grain, or of flax, or of hemp,
                            with the<lb/> same labor necessary near the great water. </p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends: We shall now end<lb/> what we have to say, with
                            informing you that<lb/>all the corn, and other productions of the
                            earth,<lb/> which <persName key="pdenn1">Philip Dennis</persName> may
                            raise, we wish our<lb/> red brethren to accept of, as a token of
                            our<lb/> friendship. And it is our desire that the chiefs<lb/> of

                        <p>Brothers, it appears to me to be necessary<lb/> that I should give you an
                            immediate answer, as<lb/> you are about to return to your families
                            from<lb/> whence you came.</p>
                        <p>My Brothers and Friends, we are all pleased<lb/> to see you here, and to
                            take our brothers, the<lb/> Quakers, through you by the hand. We
                            re-<lb/>joice that the Great Spirit has appointed that<lb/> we should
                            this day meet. For we believe, that<lb/> this meeting will be of the
                            utmost consequence<lb/> to your red brethren.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, what you have said, we have care-<lb/>fully gathered up, we
                            have placed it in our hearts,<lb/> in order that it may be communicated
                            to our<lb/> posterity. We are convinced that what you<lb/> have said is
                            for the good of your red brethren.<lb/> We are also convinced that our
                            chiefs and war-<lb/>riors, our women and children will be all of our
                                <lb/><pb n="80"/> opinion, and will be glad when they have
                            heard<lb/> what you have said.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we take you now by the hand, and<lb/> through you we take the
                            people who sent you<lb/> here by the hand, and assure you we are
                            pleased<lb/> that the Great Spirit has let us see each other,<lb/> and
                            converse together upon the subjects which<lb/> you have communicated to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, you see there is not a large num-<lb/>ber of us here. What you
                            have said to us will<lb/> not remain with those who are here alone.
                            It<lb/> will be communicated to all your red brethren<lb/> in this
                            country. And I again repeat, that I am<lb/> convinced they will be glad
                            to hear what you<lb/> have said to us, to our women and children.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, when we saw you with the rest of<lb/> our brothers in
                                <placeName key="balti1">Baltimore</placeName>, upwards of two
                            years<lb/> ago, I expect you recollect perfectly the conver-<lb/>sation
                            between us at that time and place. I,<lb/> there with my brother chiefs,
                            told you that we<lb/> were glad to find you so much disposed to
                            assist<lb/> us, our women and children. We told you that<lb/> your good
                            wished should be made known to all<lb/> your red brethren in this
                            country, which has<lb/> been done.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, ever since that time, I, as well as<lb/> some others of my
                            brother chiefs, have been en-<lb/>deavoring to turn the minds of our
                            people to-<lb/>wards the cultivation of the earth, but I am<lb/> sorry
                            to say we have not yet been able to effect<lb/> any thing.</p>
                        <pb n="81"/>
                        <p>Brothers, there are so few of our chiefs now<lb/> present, it would not
                            be proper for us to under-<lb/>take to give a pointed answer to your
                            talk. We<lb/> expect that in a few moons there will be many<lb/> of our
                            people together. At that time it will be<lb/> proper that we should
                            return an answer to all<lb/> the subjects you now mention to us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, the things you have said to us re-<lb/>quire the greatest
                            attention. It appears to me<lb/> to be really necessary to deliberate
                            upon them.<lb/> In order to do so, we must beg to leave the paper<lb/>
                            upon which they are written, that we may com-<lb/>municate them to our
                            chiefs when they assemble.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, all the words which you have said<lb/> to-day were certainly
                            calculated for our good.<lb/> You have enumerated to us the different
                            kinds<lb/> of grain and animals we ought to raise for our<lb/> comfort.
                            You have told us that if we all adopt<lb/> the plan you have proposed,
                            we should want for<lb/> nothing. This, brothers, myself and many of
                            our<lb/> people believe is true, and we hope we shall<lb/> finally be
                            able to convince our young men that<lb/> this is the plan we ought to
                            adopt to get our<lb/> living.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, you have come a long distance to<lb/> render service to us. We
                            hope that you will<lb/> meet with the success you wish, you have
                            been<lb/> very particular in pointing out to us what will<lb/> be for
                            our good. You have also been very par-<lb/>ticular in pointing out to us
                            the duties of our<lb/> women, and you have told us that in adopting<lb/>
                            <pb n="82"/> your mode of living, our numbers would increase<lb/> and
                            not diminish. In all this I perfectly agree<lb/> with you. And I hope
                            the other chiefs will<lb/> also agree with you.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we are pleased to hear you say<lb/> you are going to leave one
                            of your brothers with<lb/> us, to show us in what manner you cultivate
                            the<lb/> earth. We shall endeavor, brothers, to make<lb/> his situation
                            amongst us as agreeable to him as<lb/> will be possible for us.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, we are convinced that the plan<lb/> you propose will be highly
                            advantageous to your<lb/> red brethren. We are also convinced that
                            you<lb/> have observed very justly that we shall not then<lb/> be liable
                            to sickness. We are certain that we<lb/> shall then be able to make a
                            more comfortable<lb/> living with less labor than at present. And I<lb/>
                            hope that this will be the opinion of us all.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, assure your people who sent you<lb/> here, tell your old chiefs
                            that we are obliged to<lb/> them for their friendly offers to assist us
                            in<lb/> changing our present mode of living; tell them<lb/> that it is a
                            work which cannot be done immediate-<lb/><pb n="83"/>ly,- that we are
                            that way disposed, and we hope<lb/> it will take place gradually.</p>

                        <p>Brothers, my heart is so overjoyed and<lb/> warmed with what you have
                            said, that I find I<lb/> had forgot to mention one of the most
                            important<lb/> things.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, at the time we first met at this<lb/> place, the <persName
                                key="fmeda1">Five Medals</persName> and myself formed some<lb/> idea
                            of your business. We expected you had<lb/> come to do for us the things
                            you had proposed<lb/> to us when in <placeName key="balti1"
                                >Baltimore</placeName>. We consulted each<lb/> other upon the answer
                            necessary to return to<lb/> you in every respect, and I now find that
                            our<lb/> idea was right.</p>
                        <p>Brothers, the sentiments which I have de-<lb/>livered to you were his
                            sentiments. You have<lb/> now told us, that your brother has a mind
                            to<lb/> live amongst us to show us how to cultivate the<lb/> earth, and
                            have desired us to show him the spot<lb/> where to begin. We agreed
                            then, that he should<lb/> be at neither of our villages, lest our
                            younger<lb/> brothers should be jealous of our taking him to<lb/>
                            ourselves. We have determined to place him<lb/> on the <geogName
                                key="wabas">Waash</geogName>, where some of our families will<lb/>
                            follow him,-where our young men I hope will<lb/> flock to him, and where
                            he will be able to in-<lb/>struct them as he wished. This is all I have
                            to<lb/> say. I could all day repeat the sentiments I<lb/> have already
                            expressed; also how much I have<lb/><pb n="84"/> been gratified in
                            seeing and hearing my brothers;<lb/> but that is not necessary. I am
                            sorry, brothers,<lb/> that the chiefs of our country are not all
                            present,<lb/> that they might all hear what you have said, and<lb/> have
                            an opportunity of talking to you.</p>

                    designed to be the station of our<lb/> brother, <persName key="pdenn1">Philip
                        Dennis</persName>, and hoped some of them<lb/> would show it to us. We
                    further added, that<lb/> this did not arise from any jealousy in our<lb/> minds
                    that the place fixed upon was not suitable.<lb/> On the contrary, we had no
                    doubt that they had<lb/> judged wisely; but that the love and respect<lb/> which
                    we bore to our brother, led us to desire to<lb/> bear him company to the place,
                    and also to ren-<lb/>der him every assistance in our power before we<lb/> left
                    him.</p>
                <p>They then informed us that they would con-<lb/>sult and fix upon some one to go
                    with us. The<lb/> business of the council being then at an end, we<lb/> in turn
                    rose from our seats, and shook hands<lb/> with them, which concluded the
                    formalities of<lb/> the opportunity. After entering into a little<lb/><pb n="85"
                    /> conversation, we told them we should now bid<lb/> them farewell, as we
                    expected we should not see<lb/> them again. They then took us separately by<lb/>
                    the hand, and with marks of great affection and<lb/> friendship bade us
                    farewell, and we returned to<lb/> our quarters.</p>

                <p>Being a fine pleasant morn-<lb/>ing we set out for the place on the <geogName

                        >Mas-<lb/>sanonga, (or Clear Sky,)</persName> a handsome young man<lb/> of
                    the <orgName key="wea">Wea tribe</orgName>, deputed by the Indians to<lb/> pilot
                    us, who (by the bye) says he shall be the<lb/> first young man to take hold of
                        <persName key="pdenn1">Philip Dennis</persName>'<lb/> plough.</p>
                <p>After riding eight miles, we came to the place<lb/> called the <placeName
                        key="port">Portage</placeName>, on the <geogName key="little">Little
                        river</geogName>, a navigable<lb/> water of the <geogName key="wabas"
                        >Wabash</geogName>. Then down the margin<lb/> of the river, leaving it to
                    our left. At the end<lb/> of four miles, crossed <geogName key="sandy">Sandy
                        Creek</geogName>, another navi-<lb/>gable water of the <geogName key="wabas"
                        >Wabash</geogName>; then proceeded<lb/> through the woods, and at the end of
                    thirteen<lb/> miles further again came to <geogName key="little">Little
                        river</geogName>, at a<lb/> place called the <geogFeat key="sadd"
                        >Saddle</geogFeat>. This name is derived<lb/> from a large rock in the bed
                    of the river in the<lb/> shape of a saddle. From the <geogFeat key="sadd"
                        >Saddle</geogFeat> we pro-<lb/>ceeded six miles along the margin of the
                    river<lb/> to its junction with the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName>.</p>
                <p>The bed of the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName> here is of limestone.<lb/>
                    After riding five miles further, we came to a<lb/><pb n="86"/> vein of land
                    about one mile in width, the sur-<lb/>face of which is covered with small flint
                    stones,<lb/> and which we are told extends for several miles.<lb/>On examining
                    these flints, we found them of<lb/> excellent quality.</p>
                <p>Here the Indians supply themselves with flints<lb/> for their guns and for other
                    purposes, and here<lb/> formerly they procured their darts. It has
                    cer-<lb/>tainly been a place abundantly resorted to from<lb/> time immemorial.
                    This is evident from the sur-<lb/>face of the ground being dug in holes of two
                    and<lb/> three feet in depth, over nearly the whole tract.<lb/> This flinty vein
                    is called by the Indians <geogName key="fathf">Father<lb/> Flint</geogName>.
                    They have a tradition concerning its<lb/> origin which is very incredible. From
                    this we<lb/> proceeded, and after riding two miles, reached<lb/> the place
                    proposed by the Indians.</p>
                <p>This place is thirty-two miles rather south of<lb/> west from <placeName
                        key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>, and is situated on the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName>, at a place called the Boat-yard,
                    which<lb/> name it obtained from the circumstance of<lb/>
                    <persName key="gwilk2">General Wilkinson</persName> having built some flat,<lb/>
                    bottomed boats here, for the purpose of tran-<lb/>sporting some of the baggage
                    of the American<lb/> troops down the river. It was formerly the seat<lb/> of an
                    Indian town of the <orgName key="delaware">Delawares</orgName>, and we are<lb/>
                    pleased to find there are about twenty-five acres<lb/> of land clear. The
                        <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName> here makes a beau-<lb/>tiful
                    appearance, and is about sixty yards wide.<lb/> A little above is an island in
                    the river, on one<lb/> side of which the water runs with a strong cur-<lb/><pb
                        n="87"/>rent, and affords a good mill seat. We viewed<lb/> the land in this
                    neighborhood for a considerable<lb/> distance, and found it high and of
                    superior<lb/> quality, being covered with sugar trees of enor-<lb/>mous size,
                    black walnut, white walnut, hack-<lb/>berry, blue ash, oak buckeye trees,
                    &amp;c., all very<lb/> large. The land appears to be equal in quality<lb/> to
                    any we have seen, not excepting the bottoms<lb/> of the <geogName key="sciot"
                        >Scioto</geogName> and <geogName key="paintc">Paint Creek</geogName>. About
                    half a<lb/> mile below, a handsome creek falls into the river<lb/> from the
                    north, which we traced for a consider-<lb/>able distance, and are convinced it
                    affords a good<lb/> mill seat. This creek bearing no name, we called<lb/> it
                        <geogName key="dennc">Dennis' Creek</geogName> in honor of <persName
                        key="pdenn1">Philip Dennis</persName>. </p>
                <p>As night approached, <persName key="clear1">Massanonga</persName>, taking
                    his<lb/> knife, left us, and in about fifteen minutes re-<lb/>turned with a
                    remarkably fine turkey. This he<lb/> prepared and roasted for us in a very nice
                    and<lb/> expeditious manner, on which we fared sumptu-<lb/>ously. At 9 o'clock
                    we wrapped ourselves in<lb/> our blankets, and laid down to sleep before
                    the<lb/> fire, having no shelter. The night was frosty;<lb/> we, however, slept
                    tolerably and took no cold.</p>
                <p>In the night the otters were very noisy along<lb/> the river, the deer also
                    approached our fire and<lb/> made a whistling noise; the wolves howled, and<lb/>
                    at the dawn of day turkies gobbled in all direct-<lb/>tions.</p>

                <p>Early this morning we arose, and<lb/> breakfasted on the remains of the turkey
                    cooked<lb/> last evening, after which we fixed upon the place<lb/><pb n="88"/>
                    for <persName key="pdenn1">Philip Dennis</persName>' farm; we also staked out
                    the<lb/> situation for his wigwam, which is about one<lb/> hundred feet from the
                    banks of the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName>, and<lb/> opposite to a
                    fine spring of excellent water issuing<lb/> out of the bank of the river.</p>
                <p>We are told by several persons well acquainted<lb/> with the country, that from
                    hence to <placeName key="stvin">St. Vin-<lb/>cennes</placeName>, on the
                        <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName>, a distance of two hun-<lb/>dred
                    miles by land, and three hundred and fifty<lb/> by water, the land on both sides
                    of the river<lb/> embracing a very extensive width, is not inferior<lb/> to the
                    description given of this location in yes-<lb/>terday's notes.</p>
                <p>At <placeName key="missi1">Mississinaway</placeName>, a large Indian town of the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="miami">Miami's</orgName>, situated about thirty miles below
                    us,<lb/> on the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName>, stone coal is found,
                    which with<lb/> limestone continues for two hundred miles down<lb/> the
                    river.</p>
                <p>There are no Indians between this and <placeName key="fwayn">Fort<lb/>

                    dis-<lb/>tant. Whilst here we have seen four peroques<lb/> loaded with peltry,
                    manned by Canadians and In-<lb/>dians, on their way up the river to be
                    tran-<lb/>sported to <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>.</p>
                <p>I may here observe that the <geogName key="wabas">Wabash</geogName> affords<lb/>
                    an abundance of large turtles, called soft shelled<lb/> turtles, the outer coat
                    being a hard skin, rather<lb/> than a shell. They are esteemed excellent
                    food.<lb/> It affords a great variety of fine fish, and<lb/><pb n="89"/> we saw
                    ducks in abundance; we are told it is re-<lb/>sorted to by geese and swans.</p>
                <p>About 8 o'clock in the morning we set out<lb/> for <placeName key="fwayn">Fort

                <p>I may here observe that some days ago<lb/> we came to a conclusion to return home
                    by the<lb/> way of the lakes; to this we have been induced<lb/> from a hope that
                    we shall be subjected to fewer<lb/> difficulties and much less fatigue than to
                    retrace<lb/> the way by which we came; and I may also<lb/> add, that we have
                    been encouraged to this by<lb/> the advice of our kind friends heretofore
                    named,<lb/> who have with much apparent cheefulness<lb/> offered to prepare a

                <p>This morning we bade both a joyful<lb/> and sorrowful farewell to <persName

                    accompanied us out.<lb/> We also took leave of those generally with whom<lb/> we
                    had formed an acquaintance, first breakfast-<lb/>ing with <persName key="awhip1"
                        >Captain Whipple</persName>, whose hearty kind-<lb/>ness to us has been so
                    often repeated, that his<lb/> name will deservedly claim a place in our

                    manned it with a corporal and private<lb/> soldier from the fort; and, joined by

                    superabundant supply both for eating<lb/> and drinking.</p>
                <p>About 8 o'clock we embarked for <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>,
                    pro-<lb/>ceeded about thirty miles down the <geogName key="miamr"
                        >Miami</geogName> of the<lb/> lakes, and in the evening encamped under a
                    tent<lb/> near the margin of the river. With respect to<lb/> the appearance of
                    the country, the same old<lb/> phrase must be continued; <q>land of
                        excellent<lb/> quality.</q> We several times went ashore to view<lb/> the
                    river bottoms, they were extensive and ap-<lb/>peared to be first rate land. The
                    timber, buck<lb/> eye, ash, elm, sugar tree, oak, hickory, black<lb/> and white
                    walnut, &amp;c. We saw ducks in abun-<lb/>dance, and <persName>Corporal
                        King</persName> says they breed here<lb/> in great numbers. This river
                    affords a variety<lb/> of fine fish, and mostly of descriptions very
                    dif-<lb/>ferent from those found in our salt waters. Of<lb/> these the following
                    are some of the names;<lb/> black, yellow, and white bass, covers,
                    pickerel,<lb/> suckers, herrings, muscanago, gar, pike, catfish,<lb/>
                    sheeps-head, carp, and sturgeon. These are all<lb/> caught with the hook except
                    the two last.</p>
                <p>The sturgeon are now on their way from the<lb/> lake to the head waters of the

                        >Little Turtle</persName><lb/> very humorously proposed to <persName
                        key="jjohn2">Johnson</persName> a project,<lb/> which was to join in
                    building a stone dam at the<lb/> junction of the two rivers, to prevent the
                    sturgeon<lb/> from getting back again to the lake, and then said<lb/> he <said
                        who="lturt1">you and I will live on them this summer.</said></p>
                <p>We observed to-day (<date when="1804-04-15">15th,</date>) several hunting<lb/>
                    and sugar camps, and went on shore to visit two<lb/> of the latter. The camps
                    were well supplied<lb/> with jerk venison, dried raccoon, sturgeon,
                    &amp;c.;<lb/> one man only was at the camp, and he was em-<lb/>ployed with his
                    knife in making a paddle for his<lb/> canoe. A squaw was knitting a bag, and
                    an-<lb/>other was preparing the bark of the buckeye for<lb/> thread, strings,
                    &amp;c., by beating it with a piece<lb/> of wood. We saw amongst them several
                    fat and<lb/> healthy looking children, who were playful and<lb/> did not appear
                    to be afraid of us. The children<lb/> presented us with a quarter of fresh
                    venison, for<lb/> which we returned them some salt meat and bis-<lb/>cuit, with
                    which they were pleased. Here we<lb/> saw a child about six months old fixed to
                    a board<lb/> in the genuine Indian fashion. The board was<lb/> straight, about
                    fifteen inches in width, and two<lb/> and a half feet in length, having at its
                    head a<lb/> circular handle, and at the foot a small ledge<lb/> To this the
                    child was lashed by cloth bandages,<lb/> and so tight that it could not move
                    hand or foot.<lb/> The board was placed against a tree, almost
                    per-<lb/>pendicularly, and the infant asleep- of course in<lb/> a standing
                    position. The child was painted very<lb/><pb n="92"/> red, and had silver
                    bandages about its wrists,<lb/> and ornaments of the same metal in its
                    ears.<lb/> The Indians are very fond of their children, and<lb/> put about them
                    very costly silver ornaments.</p>
                <p>I have seen Indian children dressed in a calico<lb/> frock which was stuck with
                    silver broaches from<lb/> neck to heel, besides ornaments on the wrists,<lb/> in
                    the ear, and about the neck and head.</p>

                    night<lb/> encamped under our tent. In the evening a<lb/> severe thunder gust
                    came on, with heavy rain,<lb/> which continued for several hours after
                    night,<lb/> but having a good tent we did not get much<lb/> wetted. In the

                    Indian<lb/> hunting and sugar camps. Our Corporal is very<lb/> fond of saluting
                    the camps with an imitation of<lb/> an Indian whoop, which they are sure to
                    answer<lb/> by a similar not. This whoop very nearly re-<lb/>sembles the shrill
                    yelp of a dog. The land ap-<lb/>pears to be of an excellent quality, and deer
                    and<lb/> turkies are very numerous. Here also<lb/>

                <p>Proceeded about thirty-five miles, and at<lb/> night encamped under our tent. We
                    have been<lb/> entertained to-day with a diversified scene. The<lb/> river
                    covered with wild fowl, fish jumping up<lb/> around us, and turkies flying.</p>
                <pb n="93"/>
                <p>We stopped a short time to view the remains<lb/> of <placeName key="fdefi">Fort
                        Defiance</placeName>. This fort was built by <persName key="gwayn1"
                        >Gene-<lb/>ral Wayne</persName>, in the course of his march to attack<lb/>
                    the Indians. The situation is very beautiful and<lb/> commanding, at the
                    junction of the river <geogName key="augl">Great<lb/> Au Glaize</geogName> with
                    the <geogName key="miamr">Miami</geogName>. The two rivers<lb/> make a large
                    body of water, the width being<lb/> about two hundred yards. A Canadian
                    trader<lb/> only resides here. We also went on shore several<lb/> times to visit
                    Indian towns and camps. Great<lb/> numbers of Indians are settled upon the
                    banks<lb/> of the Miami; they are chiefly of the <orgName key="odawa"
                        >Ottoway</orgName><lb/> and <orgName key="shawnee">Shawnese</orgName>
                    tribes. They appeared pleased<lb/> at receiving visitors. Their children were
                    very<lb/> antic, and seemed to leap for joy on seeing us<lb/> land; doubtless
                    from a hope of receiving some<lb/> presents. The hunters are returning to
                    their<lb/> towns, and many of their wigwams are stocked<lb/> with peltry, dried
                    raccoon, and jerk venison.<lb/> They are on their way to the foot of the
                    rapids.<lb/> The women are mostly employed in knitting<lb/> bags and belts and
                    in making moccasins. A<lb/> considerable number of Indians are on the river<lb/>
                    in bark canoes loaded with peltry. They are on<lb/> the way to the foot of the
                    rapids and other places<lb/> for the purpose of exchanging their peltry
                    with<lb/> the traders for goods. Most of the wigwams we<lb/> have seen to-day
                    are covered with rushes sewed<lb/> together, which are procured from the shores of<lb/>
                    <geogName key="lakee">Lake Erie</geogName>, and so put together, that the
                    covering<lb/> will turn any fall of rain. An Indian house is<lb/><pb n="94"/>
                    constructed by putting two forks into the ground,<lb/> and a horizontal piece
                    from one fork to the<lb/> other. Upon this piece rest long pieces of bark,<lb/>
                    with the other end upon the earth at a conveni-<lb/>ent distance, thus
                    sheltering them from the<lb/> weather. Sometimes they make circular
                    wig-<lb/>wams, by putting small saplings into the ground<lb/> in circular order,
                    then bringing the other ends<lb/> to a point, they tie them together. These
                    they<lb/> either cover with bark or with the rush mats<lb/> before
                    described.</p>
                <p>To-day we passed a place called <placeName key="girtyt">Girty's
                    town</placeName>,<lb/> noted for the former residence of <persName key="sgirt1"

                <p>Proceeded about thirty-three miles. In<lb/> the earlier part of the day we passed
                    several<lb/> creeks and small streams, and at length reached<lb/> what is called
                    the head of the <geogName key="miamr1">rapids</geogName>. The river is<lb/> here
                    about four hundred yards wide. The noise<lb/> of the falls informed us of our
                    approach, long be-<lb/>lieve that our peroque was manned by careful<lb/> hands,
                    we resolutely entered the <geogName key="miamr1">rapids</geogName> and
                    de-<lb/>scended with great velocity down the fall for the<lb/> distance of
                    eighteen miles to the foot of the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="miamr1">rapids</geogName>. The whole of this distance is a
                    continued<lb/> fall, the land falling with the same regularity,<lb/> and
                    generally elevated but a few feet above the<lb/> surface of the water. It is
                    needless to say that<lb/> we went swiftly down, when I add, that it is a<lb/>
                    trip occupying but one hour and a half.</p>
                <p>The bed of the river is a solid limestone rock,<lb/><pb n="95"/>At the foot of
                    the <geogName key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName> we lodged all night at<lb/> the
                    house of a Canadian trader, who treated us<lb/> with great respect, and, though
                    a tavern-keeper,<lb/> would receive no pay from us for our supper,<lb/>
                    lodgings, or breakfast. A considerable encamp-<lb/>ment of Indians, who had come
                    to trade with<lb/> him was near his house. They were very merry<lb/> for a great
                    part of the night, keeping up a con-<lb/>tinued sound of their favorite
                    instruments of<lb/> music, amongst them the drum and fife. The<lb/> former is
                    made of part of the body of a hollow<lb/> tree, with the ends covered with deer
                    skin, upon<lb/> which they beat with sticks, the latter they<lb/> make of reed
                    into which they bore holes some-<lb/>what in imitation of a fife. The foot of the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="miamr1">Rapids</geogName> is rendered well known in American
                    his-<lb/>tory, as having been a place of frequent ren-<lb/>dezvous by the
                    Indians, previous to their defeat<lb/> by <persName key="gwayn1">General
                        Wayne</persName>. Here also the Indians burnt<lb/> many of the white men who
                    were taken prisoners<lb/> by them. To this place <persName key="gwayn1"
                        >Wayne</persName> marched, and<lb/> here he met and defeated the Indian
                    army.</p>
                <p>About eight miles above the foot of the <geogName key="miamr1"
                    >Rapids</geogName><lb/> and near the centre of the river, in a very rapid<lb/>
                    situation, is a noted rock called by the Cana-<lb/>dians, <geogName key="roche"
                        >Rochede Bout</geogName>, (or standing rock.) This<lb/> rock is about thirty
                    feet in height above the<lb/> surface of the water, and the same in
                    diameter.<lb/> The top has the regular appearance of the roof<lb/> of a house,
                    and the body of the rock is circular.<lb/> Its appearance is additionally
                    handsome from<lb/><pb n="96"/> the circumstance of the roof, as it is called,
                    being<lb/> covered with cedar. </p>
                <p>Fish are now passing up the <geogName key="miamir1">Rapids</geogName> in
                    great<lb/> numbers from the lakes, in so much that the water<lb/> smells
                    strongly of them. They are taken very<lb/> abundantly by the Canadians and
                    Indians. The<lb/> fisherman without seeing them strikes his barbed<lb/> spear to
                    the rocks, which often passes through<lb/> several at a time, and frequently of
                    different<lb/> kinds. The muscanonje are taken here in great<lb/> numbers; they
                    are a fish from three to five feet in<lb/> length.</p>

                <p>This morning we proceeded with diffi-<lb/>culty ten miles; owing to high winds,
                    and a rain<lb/>coming on, prudence seemed to dictate that we<lb/> should put
                    into a harbor, which we did at the<lb/> mouth of <geogName key="swanc">Swan
                        creek</geogName>, where is a small fort and<lb/> garrison lately established
                    by the United States.<lb/> Introductory letters were given us at <placeName

                        >Lieutenant Rhea</persName>, the Commandant,<lb/> which we delivered. He
                    treated us with respect,<lb/> and with him we spent the remainder of the
                    day<lb/> and lodged. On our way we stopped to view an<lb/> old fort, called
                        <placeName key="fmiam">Fort Miami</placeName>, which was garrisoned<lb/> by
                    the British at the time <persName key="gwayn1">Wayne</persName> defeated

                <p>Many Indian villages and wigwams are seated<lb/> on both shores of the river, and
                    many Canadian<lb/> traders are to be found residing amongst them.<lb/> They have
                    generally intermarried with the In-<lb/>dians, and adopted their manners. Some
                    of the<lb/><pb n="97"/> Indian houses which we passed to-day are built<lb/> of
                    small round logs, and are roofed with bark.<lb/> Near the mouth of <geogName
                        key="swanc">Swan creek</geogName> is an extensive<lb/> valley of which we
                    took a particular view. Here<lb/> the Indians placed their wives and children
                    at<lb/> the time they agreed to make battle with <persName key="gwayn1"

                <p>The river increases in width from the foot of<lb/> the <geogName key="miamr1"
                        >Rapids</geogName> toward the lake. It is more than<lb/> half a mile wide
                    opposite <geogName key="swanc">Swan creek</geogName>, and at<lb/> present has
                    the appearance of tide water; a<lb/> strong east wind having brought a heavy
                    swell<lb/> from the lake, which has in a short time raised<lb/> the river more
                    than three feet in perpendicular<lb/> height. We saw to-day geese and swans

                    beau-<lb/>tifully spotted, and is I think not inferior to any<lb/> fish I ever
                    tasted.</p>
                <p>For several days past we have been not a little<lb/> mortified at being confined
                    to a harbor, whilst<lb/> the Indians are passing us very frequently in<lb/>
                    their bark canoes. It is astonishing to see these<lb/> canoes riding large
                    swells without danger. It is<lb/> certain that they will ride waves whose
                    height<lb/> exceeds their length.</p>
                <p>Many of the bark canoes of the Indians have<lb/> fallen under our observation.
                    They are gene-<lb/>rally made of the bark of the birch tree, and<lb/> shaped
                    differently. We have seen bark canoes<lb/> loaded with two thousand five hundred
                    weight,<lb/> which were so light that two men could carry<lb/> them on their
                    shoulders with great ease. The<lb/> construction of the smaller description of
                    these<lb/> boats is so simple, that in an hour they will<lb/> have a canoe made
                    which will carry several per-<lb/>sons across their rivers. We have also seen
                    many<lb/> of their rafts. These are made for crossing<lb/> rivers at those
                    seasons of the year when it is not<lb/> easy to strip the bark from the trees.
                    In all the<lb/> river bottoms the buckeye wood is to be found.<lb/><pb n="100"/>
                    This they prefer for making a raft, on account<lb/> of its lightness when dried,
                    it being a wood nearly<lb/> as light as cork. The Indians tie together
                    small<lb/> logs of the buckeye wood, to form a square of<lb/> about five or six
                    feet, this they cross by pieces<lb/> of any other description of wood, confining
                    piece<lb/> to piece by bark strings, splits of hoop ash, &amp;c.<lb/> Upon a
                    raft of this description, three or four<lb/> persons will cross their rivers
                    even though the<lb/> currenthe against them.</p>
                <p>We had not been long in harbor, before our<lb/> anxiety to proceed exceeded our
                    patience, and<lb/> observing in view at an apparent distance of one<lb/> and a
                    half to two miles from us, about fifty<lb/> houses resembling a village, we
                    concluded to<lb/> abandon our peroque, walk to the settlement,<lb/> and then
                    endeavor to procure horses to take us<lb/> to <placeName key="detro"
                        >Detroit.</placeName></p>
                <p>At 11 o'clock this morning we set out for this<lb/> purpose, followed by our men
                    with our baggage<lb/> on their backs, and after walking over a wet<lb/> prairie,
                    through mud and water, half a leg and<lb/> more in depth, for the distance of
                    nearly six<lb/> miles, we reached the place. Viewing this set-<lb/>tlement from
                    the lake, and over a tract so level<lb/> that the elevation between it and us
                    did not ex-<lb/>ceed two feet, occasioned us to be so greatly de-<lb/>ceived in
                    the distance. On arriving we found<lb/> that, instead of a village, it was a
                    settlement of<lb/> French farmers situated along the <geogName key="raisr">river
                        Raisin</geogName>,<lb/> and presenting a very beautiful scene. The<lb/><pb
                        n="101"/> farms contain from sixty to eighty acres, laid off<lb/> in
                    parallelograms. The buildings are good, and<lb/> the gardens and orchards
                    handsome. We un-<lb/>derstand that about two miles higher up the river<lb/>
                    there is another settlement composed of about<lb/> forty families, and upon
                        <geogName key="otterc">Otter Creek</geogName>, about four<lb/> miles
                    distant, a third settlement containing about<lb/> thirty families. These people
                    are Roman Ca-<lb/>tholics. We were soon informed that the dis-<lb/>tance from
                    here to <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName> was thirty-six miles<lb/> by
                    land, and that the road passed through so flat<lb/> and wet a country, for the
                    greater part of the<lb/> way, that at this season of the year, it was
                    almost<lb/> impossible to travel it on horseback, and were<lb/> advised to wait
                    on the wind for a passage by water.<lb/> We, therefore, concluded to take
                    lodgings at<lb/> the house of <persName key="jbedi1">John Bedient</persName>,
                    who has offered to<lb/> entertain us, and dispatched our men to the boat,<lb/>
                    with instructions to come up the <geogName key="raisr">river Raisin</geogName>
                    for<lb/> us, as soon as wind and weather permitted; being<lb/> so wearied and
                    overcome with our "Jack-o-Lan-<lb/>tern" excursion, that we could not consent
                    to<lb/> retrace our steps to the boat.</p>

                <p>A strong west wind, attended with heavy<lb/> rain last night and this day, have
                    prevented our<lb/> men from getting to us. It is a fact well-known<lb/> here,
                    that northwest and west winds are as certain<lb/> to produce cloudy weather as
                    easterly winds with<lb/> us. This is doubtless owing to the humidity of<lb/> the
                    vast western lakes. The same winds are<lb/> severely cold in winter, no doubt
                    from the im-<lb/><pb n="102"/>mense bodies of ice then accumulated upon
                    those<lb/> lakes.</p>

                <p>This morning our men arrived about 8<lb/> o'clock, with the peroque, the wind
                    having abated<lb/> and weather fair. We again embarked, and<lb/> on our way down
                    the <geogName key="raisr">river Raisin</geogName> were amused<lb/> with the
                    great numbers of wild geese, which<lb/> were at play in the ponds near the
                    margin of the<lb/> river. They feed here so undisturbedly, that<lb/> though we
                    were within gun shot of them, they<lb/> took but little notice of us. We again
                    entered<lb/> the <geogName key="lakee">lake</geogName>, and encouraged our men
                    to make the<lb/> best of its smooth surface. They proceeded with<lb/> great
                    industry, and at night we reached a <orgName key="wyandot">Wyan-<lb/>dot
                        town</orgName>, called <placeName key="browt">Brown's town</placeName>,
                    making a distance<lb/> of about thirty miles. Here we concluded to<lb/> lodge at
                    the house of <persName key="wwalk1">William Walker</persName>, who is<lb/>
                    interpreter for those of the <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandot</orgName> nation
                    who<lb/> are settled on this side of the lake. He is<lb/> married to an Indian
                    woman who speaks good<lb/> English, and is very conversible. She gave us<lb/>
                    for supper bacon, bear's meat, and eggs fried,<lb/> also a dish of tea.</p>
                <p><placeName key="browt">Brownstown</placeName> is situated at the mouth of the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="detror">Detroit river</geogName>, and on the American side. The<lb/>
                    <geogName key="detror">river Detroit</geogName> is a vast body of running
                    water.<lb/> Its mouth is two miles in width, and the water<lb/> passes out of it
                    into the lake with a strong cur-<lb/>rent. Its channel is wide, generally ten
                    fathoms<lb/> in depth, and in many places much deeper. The<lb/> name <geogName
                        key="detror">Detroit river</geogName> is a corruption. Detroit, a<lb/><pb
                        n="103"/> French word, signifies the Strait, a name much<lb/> more appropos,
                    it being but an outlet from the<lb/> waters of the western lakes to <geogName

                <p>This morning our curiosity led us to<lb/> take a view of <placeName key="browt"
                        >Brownstown</placeName>. The village contains<lb/> about one hundred houses,
                    which are generally<lb/> built of small round logs, and roofed with elm<lb/>
                    bark. These Indians cultivate a considerable<lb/> quantity of corn, and their
                    fields are enclosed<lb/> with rails of their own splitting. We saw a<lb/> sample
                    of the wheat which they had raised the<lb/> last season, which looked well. They
                    have gar-<lb/>dens and a considerable number of fruit trees.<lb/> They have a
                    small number of cattle, and raise a<lb/> large number of hogs. The interpreter
                    says they<lb/> are greatly disposed to civilization, and have re-<lb/>quested of
                    the United States to furnish them<lb/> this year with cattle, instead of goods
                    or money<lb/> for their annuity.</p>
                <p>After taking breakfast, we again embarked<lb/> and proceeded up the <geogName
                        key="detror">river Detroit</geogName>, passing by<lb/> another Indian town
                    called <placeName key="walkv">Walk-in-the-Water<lb/> village</placeName>, a name
                    derived from the principal chief<lb/> of the settlement. The village contains
                    about<lb/> twenty houses, and bears the same civilized ap-<lb/>pearance as
                        <placeName key="browt">Brownstown</placeName>.</p>
                <p>After passing the <geogName key="lecas">river Le Cas</geogName> and the <geogName
                        key="rangr">river<lb/> Range</geogName>, we came opposite to a British

                    elevated position,<lb/> we beheld the horrible spectacle of two men<lb/> hanging

                <p>The white settlements, on both the American<lb/> and British shores of the
                        <placeName key="detro">Detroit</placeName>, are so near<lb/> together, that

                    see<lb/> us; they told us they had heard of the arrival of<lb/> some strangers,

                    course of conversation he in-<lb/>quired after <persName key="pyarn1">Peter
                        Yarnall</persName>, and says that <persName key="pyarn1"
                    >Peter</persName><lb/> and himself were in the same military company<lb/> during
                    the Revolutionary war; he had not heard<lb/> of his death.</p>
                <p>The following circumstance, as related by him,<lb/> making at the time
                    considerable impression upon<lb/> me, I have thought proper to record it. He
                    told<lb/> us that several officers with <persName key="pyarn1">Peter</persName>
                    and himself<lb/> were lodging together; that one night <persName key="pyarn1"
                        >Peter</persName><lb/> alarmed them all with loud screams to such a
                    de-<lb/>gree that on first awaking he supposed the enemy<lb/> had fallen upon
                    their army with bayonets. <persName key="pyarn1">Peter</persName><lb/> was on
                    his feet, and appeared to be awake. They<lb/> spoke to him repeatedly, and
                    endeavored to ap-<lb/>proach him, but every advance they made in-<lb/>creased
                    his alarm. Finally he recovered himself<lb/> and became composed, and for
                    several days after-<lb/>wards, instead of satisfying their inquiries,
                    ap-<lb/>peared to be sunk in distress and gloom. He<lb/> afterwards told them he
                    considered his alarm as<lb/> a warning to him, and that his fright arose
                    from<lb/> a plain representation of the devil, come to take<lb/> him off.
                        <persName key="pyarn1">Peter</persName> in a short time left the army,<lb/>
                    and (said the <persName key="mpike1">Major</persName>) I always believed that
                        his<lb/><pb n="107"/> reformation had its rise from that circumstance.</p>

                <p>This day we rode nine miles up the<lb/><geogName key="detror">river

                    miles in width. We had a beautiful prospect of<lb/> it, from a commanding
                    situation. I ought to<lb/> have mentioned that bordering the river, the<lb/>

                    land<lb/> is handsomely improved. The houses are so<lb/> near each other that
                    the margin of the river<lb/> looks like a village. These farms are grants<lb/>
                    made by the French government nearly a cen-<lb/>tury ago. They uniformly lie in
                    parallelograms<lb/> containing about one hundred acres. Added to<lb/> tolerable
                    dwelling houses are the handsomest<lb/>apple orchards I ever saw. The
                        extraordinary<lb/><pb n="108"/> healthfulness of the trees, indicates a

                    trees do not<lb/> thrive well, the climate being too cold for them.</p>

                    distant from the Falls. Considerable<lb/> emigrations are making from the United
                    States,<lb/> to this as well as other parts of Upper <placeName key="canad"
                        >Canada</placeName>,<lb/> owing to the very advantageous terms upon<lb/>
                    which the British Government dispose of the<lb/> land, being scarcely removed
                    from a gift.</p>
                <p>We reached a Canadian town called <placeName key="chipp1">Chippewa</placeName>,
                    <lb/> to breakfast, after which we walked to the <geogName key="niagf"
                        >Falls</geogName>,<lb/><pb n="113"/> a distance of two miles. This was a
                    walk, of<lb/> which every step seemed to increase curiosity<lb/> and surprise.
                    Our attention was soon arrested<lb/> by a cloud which hangs perpetually over the<lb/>
                    <geogName key="niagf">Falls</geogName> for the height of 600 feet, arising from
                    the<lb/> dashing of the waters.</p>
                <p>As we advanced to the <geogName key="niagf">Falls</geogName> the solid earth<lb/>
                    and rocks shook, or seemed to shake, under our<lb/> feet, whilst the roar of the
                    waters so overpowered<lb/> every other sound that, notwithstanding we were<lb/>
                    tete-a-tete, it was necessary to raise the voice to<lb/> a very loud key in
                    order to be heard. Mean-<lb/>while the cloud above mentioned issued
                    contin-<lb/>ually in what we sometimes hear called a Scotch<lb/> mist.</p>
                <p>There is a common saying, <q>Those who know<lb/> no danger, fear none.</q> This
                    was our case on re-<lb/>turning to the extremity of an overjutting rock,<lb/>
                    called <geogFeat key="trock">Table Rock</geogFeat>, opposite to the great
                    cataract,<lb/> in order to gratify our curiosity, in a peep down<lb/> the
                    precipice which is more than 150 feet per-<lb/>pendicular. In passing afterwards
                    a short dis-<lb/>tance below this rock, we were alarmed with the<lb/> discovery,
                    that the place on which we had stood<lb/> was but a thin shell, the <geogName
                        key="niagf">Falls</geogName> having under-<lb/>mined the rock for many feet.
                    Proceeding a<lb/> little lower down the <geogName key="niagf">Falls</geogName>,
                    we again found that<lb/> our second stand was almost as baseless. We<lb/>
                    however supposed that the danger was not equal<lb/> to our apprehensions, as the
                    names of great num-<lb/>bers of visitors were cut in these rocks, near
                        their<lb/><pb n="114"/> extremities. I shall not attempt to give a
                    par-<lb/>ticular description of the <geogName key="niagf">Falls of
                        Niagara</geogName>, which<lb/> has been done by persons who have visited
                    them,<lb/> for the especial purpose of gratifying the curious.<lb/> After we had
                    gratified our curiosity in a view of<lb/> them we returned to <placeName
                        key="ferie">Fort Erie</placeName>, and after<lb/> night were rowed in a
                    small boat to <placeName key="buffa">Buffalo</placeName> town,<lb/> in order to
                    be in readiness for setting out home-<lb/>ward in the morning.</p>

                <p>The person who has engaged to take us<lb/> on our journey this morning has
                    disappointed us.<lb/> The circumstance is a trial, as we have become<lb/> very
                    anxious to reach our homes. Being at lei-<lb/>sure we accompanied the Indian
                    agent in a ride,<lb/> four miles above <geogName key="buffc1">Buffalo
                        Creek</geogName>, to an Indian vil-<lb/>lage of the <orgName key="seneca"

                <p>They are making considerable progress in<lb/> agriculture, live in tolerable log
                    houses, and have<lb/> a number of cattle, horses and hogs. We saw<lb/> many of
                    them at work; they were preparing the<lb/> ground for the plough by rolling
                    logs, taking up<lb/> stumps, &amp;c. </p>
                <p>We also saw among them a large plough at<lb/> work, drawn by three yoke of oxen,
                    and attended<lb/> by three Indians. They all appeared to be very<lb/> merry, and
                    to be pleased with our visit. The<lb/> land upon which these Indians are settled
                    is of<lb/> a superior quality. We saw amongst them <persName key="redja1"
                        >Red<lb/> Jacket</persName>, <persName key="farme1">Farmers
                        Brother</persName>, and several other dis-<lb/>tinguished Chiefs. Many of
                    these Indians wor-<lb/><pb n="115"/> in their ears, and round their necks,
                    strung upon<lb/> strings, several descriptions of Lake shells. Here<lb/> we met
                    with <persName key="sacca1">Saccarissa</persName>, a principal chief of the<lb/>
                    <orgName key="tuscarora">Tuscarora</orgName> tribe. He has come for the

                        Company</orgName>. They have greatly de-<lb/>clined hunting, and are
                    becoming agriculturists.<lb/> The <orgName key="tuscarora">Tuscarora
                        Indians</orgName> removed from <placeName key="ncaro">North

                    gave<lb/> them a small tract of country, which they now<lb/> think wants
                    enlarging. It is a fact, that the<lb/><orgName key="sxntns">Six
                        Nations</orgName> have stock in the Bank of the<lb/> United States to the
                    amount of more than one<lb/> hundred thousand dollars, from which they draw<lb/>
                    regular dividends. This is money which they<lb/> received some years ago from
                    our Government<lb/> for the sale of their lands.</p>
                <p>The Chiefs and principal people took the advice<lb/> of <persName key="gwash1"

                    were killed by some fishermen with their<lb/> spears, the warm weather having

                <p>Whilst engaged in taking a copy of the pre-<lb/>ceding journal, I have been
                    induced to examine<lb/> the manuscripts left by the late <persName key="gelli1"

                    narrative, to discover<lb/> if I could find amongst them any matter
                    concern-<lb/>ing the Indians, and of the care manifested by<lb/> the <orgName
                        key="bym">Friends of Baltimore Yearly Meeting</orgName> on<lb/> their
                    behalf. In the course of this investigation<lb/> a variety of material on the
                    subjects mentioned<lb/> has presented, from which I have gleaned some<lb/>
                    fragments, which, as they promise to be inter-<lb/>esting to the readers of the
                    present day, are<lb/> herewith presented.</p>
                <p>The first extracts are from the unpublished<lb/> account of a journey to

                            forty different tribes of Indians. Of these,<lb/> the <orgName
                                key="powh">Powhatans</orgName>, the <orgName key="manah"

                                >Mona-<lb/>cans</orgName>, were the most powerful. Those
                            between<lb/> the falls of the rivers and the mountains were<lb/> divided
                            into two confederacies; the tribes in-<lb/>habiting the head waters of
                            the <geogName key="potor">Potomac</geogName> and<lb/>
                            <geogName key="rappa">Rappahannock</geogName> being attached to the
                            Manna-<lb/>hoars, and those on the upper part of <geogName key="jamer"
                                >James<lb/> river</geogName> to the <orgName key="monac"
                                >Monacans</orgName>. But the <orgName key="monac">Monacans</orgName>
                            and<lb/> their friends were in amity with the <orgName key="manah"
                                >Mannahoars</orgName><lb/> and their friends, and waged joint and
                            perpetual<lb/> war against the <orgName key="powh">Powhatans</orgName>.
                            We are told that<lb/> the <orgName key="powh">Powhatans</orgName>,
                                <orgName key="manah">Mannahoacs</orgName>, and <orgName key="monac"
                                >Monacans</orgName>,<lb/> spoke languages so radically different,
                            that in-<lb/>terpreters were necessary when they transacted<lb/>
                            business. Hence we may conjecture that this<lb/> was not the case
                            between all the tribes, and prob-<lb/>ably that each spoke the language
                            of the nation<lb/> to which it was attached, which is known to<lb/> have
                            been the case in many particular instances.<lb/> Very possibly there may
                            have been anciently<lb/> three different stocks, each of which
                            multiplying<lb/> in a long course of time, had separated into so<lb/>
                            many little societies. This practice results from<lb/><pb n="123"/> the
                            circumstance of their never having submitted<lb/> themselves to any
                            laws, any coercive power, or<lb/> any shadow of government. Their only
                                con-straints<lb/><del resp="undtermined">trasts</del> are their
                            manners, and that moral sense of<lb/> right and wrong which, like the
                            sense of tasting<lb/> and feeling in every man, makes a part of his<lb/>
                            nature. An offence against these is punished<lb/> by contempt, by
                            exclusion from society, or, where<lb/> the case is serious, as that of
                            murder, by the in-<lb/>dividuals whom it concerns. Imperfect as this
                            spe-<lb/>cies of coercion may seem, crimes are very rare<lb/> amongst
                            them, in so much that were it made a ques-<lb/>tion whether no law, as
                            among the native Ameri-<lb/>cans, or too much law, as among the
                            civilized Euro-<lb/>peans, submits men to the greatest evil; one
                            who<lb/> has seen both conditions of existence would pro-<lb/>nounce it
                            to be the last, and that the sheep are<lb/> happier of themselves, than
                            under the care of<lb/> wolves. It will be said that great societies
                            can-<lb/>not exist without the aid of government. The<lb/> savages
                            therefore break themselves into small<lb/> ones. The territories of the
                                <orgName key="powh">Powhatan</orgName> confede-<lb/>racy south of
                            the <geogName key="potor">Potomac</geogName>, comprehended about<lb/>
                            8000 square miles, 30 tribes, and 2400 hundred<lb/> warriors. <persName
                                key="csmith">Captain Smith</persName> tells us that within<lb/> 60
                            miles of <placeName key="jtown1">Jamestown</placeName> were 5000 people,
                            of<lb/> whom 1500 were warriors. From this we find<lb/> the proportion
                            of their warriors to their whole<lb/> inhabitants was as 3 to 10.<lb/>
                            The <orgName key="powh">Powhatan</orgName><lb/> confederacy then would
                            cosist of about 8,000<lb/> inhabitants, which was one for every
                                square<lb/><pb n="124"/> mile; being about the twentieth part of
                            our<lb/> present population in the same territory, and the<lb/> hundreth
                            of that of the British Islands. The<lb/> numbers of some of them are
                            stated as they<lb/> were in the year <date when="1669">1669</date>, when
                            an attempt was<lb/> made by the Assembly to enumerate them.<lb/>
                            Probably the enumeration is imperfect, and in<lb/> some measure
                            conjectural, and that a further<lb/> search into the records would
                            furnish many more<lb/> particulars. What would be the melancholy<lb/>
                            sequel of their hsitory, may, however, be<lb/> augured from the census
                            of <date when="1669">1669</date>, by which we<lb/> discover that the
                            tribes therein mentioned and<lb/> enumerated, were, in the space of 62
                            years re-<lb/>duced to about one-third of their former number.<lb/>
                            Spirituous liquors, the small pox, war, and an<lb/> abridgment of
                            territory, to a people who lived<lb/> principally on the spontaneous
                            productions of<lb/> nature, had committed great havoc among them.<lb/>
                            That the lands of this country (<placeName key="virgi"
                                >Virginia</placeName>,) were<lb/> taken from them by conquest, is
                            not so general<lb/> a truth as is supposed. We find in our
                            histo-<lb/>ries and records, repeated proofs of purchase<lb/> which
                            cover a considerable part of the lower<lb/> country, and many more would
                            doubtless be<lb/> found on further search. The upper country,<lb/> we
                            know, has been acquired altogether by pur-<lb/>chases made in the most
                            unexceptionable form,<lb/> westward of all these tribes, beyond the
                            moun-<lb/>tains, and extending to the great lakes on the<lb/>
                            <orgName key="massaw">Massawomics</orgName>, a most powerful
                            confederacy, who<lb/><pb n="125"/> harassed unremittingly the <orgName

                                >Man-<lb/>nahoacs</orgName>. These were probably the ancestors<lb/>
                            of the tribes known at present by the name<lb/> of the <orgName

                            The several towns<lb/> or families that compose the tribes have a
                            chief<lb/> who presides over it, and the several tribes com-<lb/>posing
                            a nation have a chief who presides over<lb/> the whole nation. Those
                            chiefs are generally<lb/> men advanced in age, and distinguished for
                            their<lb/> prudence and abilities in council; the matters<lb/> which
                            merely regard a town or family, are settled<lb/> by the chief and
                            principal men of the town,<lb/> those which regard a tribe, such as the
                            appoint-<lb/>ment of head warriors or captains, and settling<lb/>
                            differences between tribes and families, are reg-<lb/>ulated at a
                            meeting of the chiefs from the differ-<lb/>ent towns; and those which
                            regard the whole<lb/> nation, such as making war, concluding peace,
                            or<lb/> forming alliances with the neighboring nations.<lb/> are
                            deliberated and determined in a national<lb/> council, composed of the
                            chiefs of the tribes, at-<lb/>tended by their head warriors, and a
                            number of<lb/> chiefs from the towns, who are his counsellors.<lb/> In
                            every town, there is a council house, where<lb/> the chiefs and men of
                            the town assemble when<lb/> occasion requires, and consult what is
                            proper to<lb/> be done. Every tribe has a fixed place for the<lb/> chief
                            of the towns to meet and consult on the<lb/><pb n="127"/> business of
                            the tribe. And in every nation,<lb/> there is what they call the central
                            council house,<lb/> or council fire, where the chiefs of the
                            several<lb/> tribes, with the principal warriors, convene to<lb/>
                            consult and determine on their national affairs.<lb/> When any matter is
                            proposed in the national<lb/> council, it is common for the chiefs of
                            the seve-<lb/>ral tribes to consult thereon apart with their<lb/>
                            counsellors, and when they have agreed, to deliver<lb/> the opinion of
                            the tribe at the national council.<lb/> And as their government seems to
                            rest wholly<lb/> on persuasion, they endeavor by mutual
                            conces-<lb/>sions to obtain unanimity. Such is the govern-<lb/>ment that
                            still exists among the Indian nations<lb/> bordering on the United
                            States. To the north-<lb/>ward of these, there was another powerful
                            nation,<lb/> which occupied the country from the head of<lb/> the
                                <geogName key="chesab">Chesapeake Bay</geogName>, up to the

                            another, by natural boundaries, such as ranges<lb/> of mountains or
                            streams of water. But as the<lb/> heads of rivers frequently interlock
                            or approach<lb/><pb n="128"/> near to each other, as those who live upon
                            a stream<lb/> claim the country watered by it, they often
                            en-<lb/>croached on each other, and this was a constant<lb/> source of
                            war between the different nations.</p>

                            close confederacy, and occupied that tract<lb/> of country from the last

                            only<lb/> exerted their whole force, but put in practice<lb/> every
                            measure which prudence or policy could<lb/> devise to bring it to a
                            successful issue. For<lb/> this purpose they bent their course down the<lb/>
                            <placeName key="susqueh">Susquehanna</placeName>, warring with the

                                >Mo-<lb/>hiccons</orgName> and river Indians, and compelled

                        <p>The <orgName key="delaware">Lenapi</orgName> being surrounded with

                    <lb/> whereby a peace had been concluded between<lb/> the United States and the

                        Ohio</geogName>. For many years those<lb/> Indians had proved themselves to

                    them, and of the armies of the<lb/> United States, sent out to compel them to

                    under the French commanders in former wars,<lb/> they adhered to any pacific
                    agreements no longer<lb/> than their fears or their interests restrained<lb/>

                    defeated <persName key="jharm1">General Harmer</persName>, with the<lb/> loss of

                    routed. In this engagement the <persName key="lturt1">Little<lb/>
                        Turtle</persName>,* <note rend="asterisk">* Michikiniqua, was the Indian
                        name of this chief.</note> so often alluded to in the foregoing<lb/> pages,
                    was the commander-in-chief of the Indian<lb/> forces, and displayed feelings of
                    humanity to-<lb/>wards his retreating foes, of which few exam-<lb/>ples have
                    been furnished in the history of Indian<lb/> warfare, and which reflects honor
                    on his cha-<lb/>racter.</p>
                <p>On beholding the white soldiers fleeing before<lb/> the exasperated Indians, and
                    at every moment<lb/> cut down by the weight of their tomahawks, his<lb/> heart
                    revolted at the sight, and ascending an<lb/> eminence, he gave the <del
                        resp="undetermined">singular</del> signal cry, which com-<lb/>manded his men
                    to cease from further pursuit<lb/> and return to their camps; he also sent out
                    mes-<lb/>sengers to inform them, wherever scattered,<lb/> that <said

                        having killed enough.</said> By this effort on his<lb/> part many lives were
                    spared.</p>
                <p>After this defeat, so unlooked for by the<lb/> United States, <persName
                        key="gwayn1">General Wayne</persName>, who had suc-<lb/>ceeded <persName
                        key="gstcl1">General St. Clair</persName>, arrived with his army<lb/> upon
                    the location where that officer had been<lb/> defeated, in the <date
                        when="1793-09">9th month, (Sept.) 1793</date>, and<lb/> immediately built
                        <placeName key="fwayn">Fort Wayne</placeName>. The next year<lb/> he brought
                    the Indians to a decisive engage-<lb/>ment in the vicinity, in which they were
                    over-<lb/>thrown with great slaughter. This humiliation<lb/> lessened their high
                    estimate of their own strength<lb/> and disposed them to peace, and a treaty
                    was<lb/> concluded between them and <persName key="gwayn1">General
                        Wayne</persName>,<lb/> who acted as a commissioner of the United<lb/>
                    States, at <placeName key="greenv">Grenville</placeName>, (<date when="1794"
                        >1794</date>), by which the tribes<lb/> northwest of the <geogName
                        key="ohior">river Ohio</geogName>, gave up the lands<lb/> so long the object
                    of contention, and accepting<lb/> a reservation in the neighborhood of the
                    Lakes,<lb/> came under the protection of the United States,<lb/> upon terms at
                    that time considered mutually<lb/> satisfactory and beneficial.</p>
                <p>The <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>, who appears to have had
                    a<lb/> just idea of the importance of the lands about<lb/> to be ceded to our
                    government, remained for a<lb/> long time inflexible, resolved upon
                    procuring<lb/> more favorable conditions. He was deeply at-<lb/>tached to the
                    country which had been his birth-<lb/>place, and in common with all his
                    brethren<lb/> considered it belonged to the Indians by right<lb/> of possession
                    from the Great Spirit, who, they<lb/><pb n="135"/> believed, after he had made
                    the earth, sun,<lb/> moon and stars, had placed the red man on this<lb/>
                    continent, and bestowed it upon him and his<lb/> children. He knew also, that
                    the whole region<lb/> around was made dear to them by every cher-<lb/>ished
                    remembrance; their recollections of the<lb/> happy abode of the red people
                    therein for many<lb/> generations before the coming of the white men<lb/> to
                    settle amongst them; as connected also with<lb/> the sports and pastimes of
                    their youth, and with<lb/> the enjoyments of their more manly pursuits in<lb/>
                    maturer years, and moreover as containing the<lb/> graves and other monuments of
                    their fathers.<lb/> These recollections were all quickened and in-<lb/>creased
                    in importance by the knowledge that, in<lb/> relinquishing the possession of
                    this fine territory,<lb/> they yielded up forests filled with herds of
                    deer,<lb/> and other game which, by the addition of the<lb/> fruits of their
                    grounds, rich and fertile almost<lb/> without precedent, gave them, even with
                    their<lb/> rude mode of tillage, an ample supply for their<lb/> simple wants. He
                    seemed also to be filled with<lb/> apprehension, lest when settled within the
                    con-<lb/>fined boundaries, which were to be theirs by the<lb/> conditions of the
                    treaty, that his countrymen<lb/> would be too slow in adopting the habits of
                    civil-<lb/>ized life; and as the supply of wild animals must<lb/> soon be
                    exhausted, would suffer many privations<lb/> in consequence of the change. As
                    such were<lb/> his feelings, can any thoughtful person be as-<lb/>tonished at
                    his resolutions?<lb/></p>
                <pb n="136"/>
                <p>Convinced at last, that no alternative awaited<lb/> him, he consented to sign the
                    compact, remark-<lb/>ing to the officers present, as he affixed his
                    sig-<lb/>nature, <said who="lturt1">I have been the last to consent to this<lb/>
                        agreement; I will be the last to break it.</said> He<lb/> remained true to

                    <body>
                        <p>While we were at <placeName key="sand">Sandusky</placeName> and in other
                                In-<lb/><pb n="156"/>dian villages, our minds were often deeply
                            af-<lb/>fected under the sorrowful consideration of the<lb/> baneful
                            effect of spirituous liquors on them, being<lb/> abundantly supplied
                            with it in almost every vil-<lb/>lage by Canadian traders residing among
                            them;<lb/> and we are confirmed in the opinion, that unless<lb/> the
                            traders can be restrained from furnishing<lb/> them with this
                            destructive article, in exchange<lb/> for their skins and furs, they
                            will not easily be<lb/> persuaded to turn their minds towards
                            agricul-<lb/>ture and the useful arts. At the same time, we<lb/> have no
                            doubt that these unprincipled men will<lb/> make use of the great
                            influence they have over<lb/> the Indians to keep them in their present
                            mode<lb/> of living, as most conducive to their own in-<lb/>terests.
                            Notwithstanding this cause of dis-<lb/>couragement, the great affection

                        <p>Brothers and Friends: I am desirous in the<lb/> early part of this
                            opportunity, that you may be<lb/> informed, that the people called
                            Quakers con-<lb/>sider all mankind as their brothers: that they<lb/>
                            believe the Great Spirit and Father of all man-<lb/>kind created all men
                            of one blood; and that it<lb/> is the will of Him who also created the
                            sun,<lb/> the moon, and the stars, and causes them to give<lb/> us
                            light,-the Great Spirit and common Father<lb/> of all mankind,-that we
                            should not do one another<lb/> hurt, but that we should do one another
                            all the<lb/> good we can; and it is on this ground, and this<lb/>
                            principle, that we believe it right to take you by<lb/> the hand.</p>
                    </body>

                <p>Then after a short time spent in silence, an-<lb/>other member of the Society of
                    Friends, <persName key="jmcki1">John<lb/> M'Kim</persName>, spoke, declaring
                        <said who="jmcki1">that the Quakers be-<lb/>lieved it required of them to
                        love all men,<lb/> without reference to location or complexion;<lb/> that
                        they were convinced it was not in their<lb/> power to perform their
                        religious duties to the<lb/> Great Creator of all things without his
                        assistance,<lb/> and therefore felt it their duty, when entering<lb/> upon
                        such important business as that in which<lb/> they were about to engage, to
                        sit down in<lb/> stillness and wait upon Him.</said> After some-<lb/>thing
                    more on this subject, and a reference to<lb/> the <orgName key="pym">Yearly

                        >Balti-<lb/>more</placeName></orgName>, he proceeded to say that <said
                        who="jmcki1">the Friends re-<lb/><pb n="162"/>membered the friendship which
                        had subsisted<lb/> between their Society and the Indians, from<lb/> their
                        first settlement in America; and recollect-<lb/>ing that the Western country
                        was fast filling up<lb/> with white people, and that game would
                        ne-<lb/>cessarily become scarce, they feared the Indians<lb/> would be
                        brought into a state of suffering.<lb/> That, in consequence of the long
                        wars that had<lb/> subsisted between them and some of the white<lb/> people,
                        the Friends for a long time had not had<lb/> an opportunity of taking them
                        by the hand.<lb/> That so soon as an opportunity had presented,<lb/> after a
                        peace was effected, a concern had arisen<lb/> in their council, and several
                        Friends were ap-<lb/>pointed to go out into the wilderness and have a<lb/>
                        talk with them.</said> He then called upon the<lb/> Friend who sat at his
                    right hand, <persName key="ethom1">Evan Thomas</persName>,<lb/> who had been one
                    of the mission to the Plains<lb/> of <placeName key="sand">Sandusky</placeName>,
                    to give an account of the move-<lb/>ment in this concern. <persName key="ethom1"
                        >Evan Thomas</persName> then gave<lb/> a very concise relation of the
                    journey, and the<lb/> conference with the <orgName key="wyandot"

                    <persName key="pthom1">Philip E. Thomas</persName>,) and proceeded to inform
                    the<lb/> deputation that the Friends had received no re-<lb/>sponse to the
                    proposals then made to the In-<lb/>dians; but a belt of wampum and a speech

                        <p>Brothers and Friends: We were glad when<lb/> we heard that some of our
                            Red brethren were<lb/> coming to this city, and felt our minds
                            drawn<lb/> to take them by the hand, and have an oppor-<lb/>tunity of
                            knowing them. As we have not been<lb/> made acquainted with their
                            circumstances, we<lb/> have not been able to judge whether any
                            thing<lb/> we have had to propose to do for them would be<lb/> accepted?
                            Whether they are really under the<lb/> necessity of applying to some
                            other mode of<lb/> living to obtain a livelihood, and whether game
                            in<lb/> their country is yet plenty? We have thought,<lb/> brothers,
                            that if it should not yet be the case,<lb/> that game is scarce, at the
                            present time, it will<lb/> probably be the case in some future time;
                            and,<lb/> therefore, we have thought it would be best for<lb/> our Red
                            brethren to give some attention to the<lb/> cultivation of the soil.
                            This is one of the subjects<lb/> which has claimed our attention; and as
                            we feel<lb/> in our hearts that we love the Indians and desire<lb/>
                            their welfare, we wish to turn their attention to the<lb/> subject; we
                            also believe, brothers, that we<lb/> derive a very great advantage from
                            reading<lb/> books which contain instruction, we wish that<lb/> our
                            brethren, the Indians, should partake of the<lb/> same means of
                            instruction with ourselves. We<lb/> wish you to let us know with candor,
                            whether<lb/> you desire these things, and if you do so, that<lb/> we may
                            do for you whatever may be in our<lb/> power.</p>

                <p>After a short pause, the <persName key="lturt1">Little Turtle</persName>
                    inquired<lb/> if the Friends had any thing more to say, and<lb/> being told that
                    we were all willing to listen to<lb/> him, he rose up and said:</p>
                <p><said who="lturt1">Brothers and Friends: My heart returns<lb/> thanks to the

                        brothers, the Quakers, have such<lb/> great compassion for their Red
                        brethren.</said> He<lb/> then spoke of the belief of the Indians, <said

                        made, to be useful<lb/> to them and give them light.</said> After
                    referring<lb/> to the desire of the Friends to benefit the In-<lb/>dians, and
                    their need of that assistance, he<lb/> added: <said who="lturt1">You have been

                            you.</p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends:-I am glad you have<lb/> seen this business as we

                            remove this great evil out of our country; an<lb/> evil that has had so
                            much ruin in it,-that has<lb/> destroyed so many of our lives, that it
                            causes our<lb/> young men to say, <said>We had better be at war<lb/>
                                with the white people.</said> This liquor that they<lb/> introduce
                            into our country, is more to be feared<lb/> than the gun or the

                            what we intend to make known to the Great<lb/> Council of our White

                            that<lb/> have arisen in our country, from the introduc-<lb/>tion of
                            this liquor by the white traders. </p>
                        <p>Brothers and Friends: In addition to what<lb/> I have observed of this

                            further,<lb/> that it has made us poor. It is this liquor that<lb/>
                            causes our young men to go without clothes, and<lb/> our women and
                            children to go without anything<lb/> to eat, and sorry I am to mention
                            now to you,<lb/> brothers, the evil is increasing every day, as the<lb/>
                            white settlers come nearer to us, and bring those<lb/> kettles they boil
                            that stuff in they call whiskey,<lb/> of which our young men are so
                            extremely fond.<lb/> Brothers, when our young men have been out<lb/>
                            hunting, and are returning home loaded with<lb/> skins and furs, on
                            their way, if it happened that<lb/> they come along where some of this
                            whiskey is<lb/> deposited, the White man who sells it, tells them<lb/>
                            to take a little drink; some of them will say<lb/> no, I do not want it;
                            they go on until they<lb/> come to another house, where they find more
                            of<lb/> the same kind of drink; it is there again offered,<lb/> they
                            refuse, and again the third time; but<lb/> finally the fourth or fifth
                            time, one accepts of it<lb/> and takes a drink, and getting one, he
                            wants<lb/> another, and then a third, and fourth, till his<lb/> senses
                            have left him. After this, reason comes<lb/> back to him; when he gets
                            up and finds where<lb/> he is, and asks for his peltry, the answer is,
                            you<lb/> have drunk them. Where is my gun? It is<lb/><pb n="173"/> gone.
                            Where is my blanket? It is gone.<lb/> Where is my shirt? You have sold
                            it for<lb/> whiskey! Now, brothers, figure to yourselves<lb/> what a
                            condition this man must be in;<lb/> he has a family at home, a wife and
                            children,<lb/> who stand in need of the profits of his hunting,<lb/>
                            what must their wants be, when he himself is<lb/> also without a shirt.

                <p>After expressing his<lb/> hope that the Great Spirit would aid the<lb/> Friends
                    in their efforts to assist the Indians, and<lb/> that they would use any
                    influence they possessed<lb/> with the great council of the United States
                    on<lb/> their behalf, and again alluding to the baneful<lb/> effects of
                    spirituous liquors, and the bad advice<lb/> of wicked men who wished to keep
                    them in ig-<lb/>norance, he finished by declaring that he desired<lb/> all that

                            large a man to give so poor a display of<lb/> Indian politeness, and
                            that he would return to<lb/> his home in the same state of ignorance in

                            made a short address, in which he acknowledged<lb/> the pleasure it

                            he felt<lb/> obliged, and of whom he entertained the highest<lb/>

                            shoulders. His<lb/> face was painted; the cheeks and forehead<lb/>
                            black, and across one of his cheeks was a heavy<lb/> dash of vermillion,
                            which looked like a deep and<lb/> gaping flesh wound. His hair, which
                            was thick<lb/> and coarse, was cut about six inches long in<lb/> front,
                            and hung about his face, but was its full<lb/> length behind, and tied
                            in several places with<lb/> bands of buckskin, and powdered with red
                            paint;<lb/> and he wore on the top of his head, a small<lb/> coronet of

                            was<lb/> a full suit, and without any admixture of grey,<lb/><pb n="190"

                            years old.<lb/> His dress was completed by a long, red, military<lb/>
                            sash around the waist, and his hat (a chapeau<lb/> bras) was ornamented
                            by a red feather. Imme-<lb/>diately on entering the house, he took off
                            his<lb/> hat, and carried it under his arm during the<lb/> rest of the
                            visit. His appearance and manners,<lb/> which were graceful and
                            agreeable, in an un-<lb/>common degree, were admired by all who
                            made<lb/> his acquaintance.</p>
                        <p>When seated at table they seemed to enjoy the<lb/> repast which was set
                            before them. A large<lb/> dish of hominy- a national dish with the
                            In-<lb/>dians- had with a variety of other dishes been<lb/> served up,
                            especially in reference to their tastes,<lb/> and was acceptable to
                            them. The <persName key="rave1">Raven</persName>,<lb/> on taking his
                            seat, immediately pointed it out to<lb/> his wife, who sat at his side,
                            and spoke for the<lb/> first time since his entrance, to request to
                            be<lb/> helped bountifully to the hominy, having seen<lb/> nothing he
                            liked so well since he had left the woods.</p>
                        <p>The visit ended very agreeably; the deputa-<lb/>tion shook hands with the

                        <p>We were told that they spent a part of the<lb/> day seated upon the
                            rocks, contemplating the<lb/> scenery before them; they were afterwards
                            at-<lb/>tracted to a point where hickory nuts and per-<lb/>simmons were
                            abundant, and the Chief was seen<lb/> climbing the trees, and gathering
                            the persim-<lb/>mons and nuts, and throwing them down to his<lb/> wife,
                            who seemed fond of them. Thus, they had<lb/> passed the day, and looked
                            refreshed thereby.</p>
                        <p>Both <persName key="marp1">Marpau</persName> and the <persName

                            careful to present themselves, on<lb/> all occasions, where there was a
                            chance of their<lb/> being seen, painted and adorned in their most<lb/>
                            approved style. Thus, while in <placeName key="wash"

                                >Baltimore</placeName>, although in comparative retire-<lb/>ment, as
                            he did not go out, <persName key="marp1">Marpau</persName> was said
                            to<lb/> spend two or three hours daily, in the duties of<lb/> the
                            toilet, painting his face, dressing his hair,<lb/> and arranging his
                            appearance, by a small mirror,<lb/> held up before him by his wife, who
                            stood near him<lb/> for the purpose, pronouncing occasionally on
                            the<lb/> effect produced, and giving instructions. Similar<lb/>
                            attentions were conferred by the wife of the<lb/>
                            <persName key="rave1">Raven</persName> on her husband, but as he was of
                            lower<lb/> rank, and rather older than <persName key="marp1"
                                >Marpau</persName>, his toilet<lb/> was less elaborate, and occupied
                            less time.</p>
                        <p>The next day after this ramble, the <orgName key="potaw">Potawo-

                                before.<lb/><pb n="192"/> The other Indians, with the interpreter,
                            examined<lb/> all the objects of interest in the neighborhood.<lb/> They

                            and spoke with as<lb/> much approbation as an Indian ever speaks of<lb/>
                            things which he admires, of the ingenuity ex-<lb/>hibited in the flour
                            and paper mills. The next<lb/> day all the deputation left for their

                            regarding<lb/> goods and money, had been badly paid, and during<lb/> his

                            asked advice of the Friend who met him at the<lb/> hotel, and was
                            encouraged to make a faithful<lb/> statement of wrongs done to the

                    ceded sixteen smaller tracts as sites<lb/> for Forts, trading stations, &amp;c.
                    They received<lb/> in consideration of the cession, twenty thousand<lb/> dollars
                    in goods, and permanent annuities amount-<lb/>ing to eleven thousand dollars;
                    $9,500 in goods<lb/> delivered, the cost of delivery and distribution<lb/> being
                    $1,500. The annuities, at 5 percent re-<lb/>presents a capital of $220,000; thus
                    the entire<lb/> payment would be $240,000 for 16,000,000<lb/> acres of land, or
                    one cent and a half per acre.</p>
                <p>The annuities of several of the tribes com-<lb/>menced at once, and are still
                    paid regularly<lb/> under the treaty of <placeName key="greenv"
                        >Greeneville</placeName>, and they re-<lb/>ceive additional annuities under
                    other treaties.<lb/> Indeed all the tribes who were parties to the<lb/> treaty
                    of <placeName key="greenv">Greeneville</placeName>, received regular
                        annuities<lb/><pb n="196"/> from the Government, but I have not been
                    able<lb/> to trace in them the specific amounts granted by<lb/> that treaty. </p>
