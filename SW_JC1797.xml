                <p>In the fall semester of 2010, Swarthmore students enrolled in English 50A
                    (“Reading Red, White, and In-Between in Early American Literature”) transcribed
                    a number of journals, both published and in manuscript form, which document the
                    interaction of Quakers and Native Americans. In 2014 a decision was made to
                    encode these and other journals as part of a larger project to make the
                    library’s rich store of Quaker Indian mission writings more accessible. The
                    project was designed by Christopher Densmore, Curator of Friends Historical
                    Library.</p>

                <p> In the year 1797, <persName key="jparr1">John Parrish</persName>, a friend and
                    fa-<lb/> ther in the church, suggested the advantage that<lb/> might arise to
                    the Indian natives, by bringing a few<lb/> of their young females into this part
                    of the country,<lb/> in order to instruct them in the useful arts of do-<lb/>
                    mestic economy, by pitting them in the families<lb/> of suitable Friends, where
                    they might be carefully educated. </p>
                <pb n="368" facs="SW_JC1797_Page_02"/>
                <p> This being a very weighty matter, claimed my<lb/> serious attention, and was
                    laid before the committee<lb/> appointed by the Yearly Meeting, for promoting
                    the<lb/> improvement and gradual civilization of the Indian<lb/> natives. The
                    proposal was acceded to by the com-<lb/>mittee, who furnished me with a
                    certificate, expres-<lb/>sive of their unity therewith, and addressed to
                    the<lb/> Indians, as follows: </p>

                    a few lines from you. We were glad to hear from<lb/> you, and that your young
                    men were encouraged to<lb/> walk in the good path, we recommended to you.
                    It<lb/> did our hearts good, when he told us that you had<lb/> raised corn,
                    wheat, and other grain, to supply your-<lb/>selves till next crop. We wish you
                    all to be sober<lb/> and industrious, and learn to be good farmers. </p>
                <p> Brothers, we understand that you are desirous a<lb/> few of your girls should be
                    placed in the families of<lb/> some of our friends, and be taught what our
                    daugh-<lb/>ters are. We rejoice at it, and are willing to take<lb/> three of
                    them; and our friend, <persName key="jclar1">Joseph Clark</persName>, has<lb/>
                    agreed to assist in bringing them safe down. They<lb/> (<persName key="hsimm1"
                        >H. Simmons</persName> and <persName key="jclar1">J. Clark</persName>) will
                    deliver you this.<lb/>We also have agreed to take two girls from <orgName

                        key="tuscarora">Tuscaroras</orgName>. </p>
                <p> Brothers, we expect the girls you send us,<lb/> will remain till they are
                    eighteen years of age, as our<lb/> daughters are placed by their parents or
                    friends to<lb/> learn what we want your daughters should know;<lb/> that is,
                    spinning, weaving, how to make butter, and<lb/>
                    <pb n="369" facs="SW_JC1797_Page_03"/> such other things as are useful on a
                    farm. We shall<lb/> place them in such families as will use them kindly,<lb/>

                <p>Having laid the subject before my family, after<lb/> about two weeks'
                    consideration and preparation, I<lb/> took an affectionate leave of them on
                    the<lb/> 16th of the 10th month, 1797, and went to <placeName key="brist"
                        >Bristol</placeName> in Bucks<lb/> county, where I met with my friend,
                        <persName key="hsimm1">Henry Sim-<lb/>mons</persName>, jun. who was to be my
                    companion in the jour-<lb/>ney, which was very satisfactory. But he was
                    taken<lb/> unwell, after travelling about twenty miles, and con- <lb/> tinued so
                    during all the journey. </p>
                <p> When we arrived at New York, a number of ar-<lb/>ticles were purchased for
                    clothing for the girls, and<lb/> we prosecuted our journey till, in due season,
                    we<lb/> arrived at <placeName key="oneida">Oneida</placeName>, in the state of
                    New York, where<lb/> we were received with marks of affection, by the<lb/>
                    Indians. I was taken to the house of one of the<lb/> Chiefs, his wife having
                    been informed concerning<lb/> my coming. </p>

                    He is an<lb/> orderly and sensible man. </p>
                <p> We also had a conference with the <orgName key="stockbridge"
                        >Stockbridge</orgName> and<lb/>
                    <orgName key="tuscarora">Tuscarora</orgName> Indians; at which we produced our

                    sentences and words. <persName key="haupa1">Hendrick Apaumut</persName><lb/> was

                    At this conference, the<lb/> Indians seemed fully satisfied with the
                    proposals<lb/> made to them. We informed them that Friends had<lb/> nothing but
                    love for them and their children; and<lb/> as it was their desire that we should
                    take their chil-<lb/>dren, we would do it at Friends' expense. On which<lb/>
                    information, they acknowledged Friends' love for<lb/> them. </p>

                <p> —Had a conference with the prin- <lb/> cipal Chief of the <orgName key="oneida"
                        >Oneidas</orgName>, about the girls. He re-<lb/>marked, that those of the

                    in-<lb/>stances in the neighbourhood. He further observed,<lb/> that they would
                    rather the sons of Onas, (meaning of<lb/>
                    <persName key="wpenn1">William Penn</persName>,) should have their people or
                    children,<lb/> than any other people; but their judgment was, for<lb/> our women
                    to come and instruct them; which would<lb/> better preserve their morals, and be
                    of far greater<lb/> utility amongst the Indians, and which they always<lb/>
                    understood would be the case, from the first proposal<lb/> made by the
                    committee. In answer to all this, I re-<lb/>plied, <said who="jclark1">Great
                        trees grow slow;</said> meaning great<lb/> matters take time to accomplish. </p>
                <p> He called upon me twice after this, to write a piece<lb/> for their nation. At
                    first, I declined; but, upon the<lb/> second application, I complied, well
                    knowing that<lb/> what they requested was the mind of Friends, and<lb/> also of
                    Government. When it was written, they con-<lb/>ferred together about its
                    contents; and next day I was<lb/> informed by their Chief that they approved
                    thereof.<lb/> The purport of it was to warn off some bad tenants,<lb/> who had
                    settled on their land contrary to law. The<lb/> Chief gave me a name, Onas,
                    signifying the man who <lb/>
                    <pb n="371" facs="SW_JC1797_Page_05"/> uses a pen, which I thought no way
                    suitable for my<lb/> small abilities.</p>

                <p> Being frequently in company with the <orgName key="stockbridge"
                        >Stockbridge</orgName>
                    <lb/> Indians, I was induced to believe they are superior,<lb/> especially the
                    women, to many under our name, who<lb/> make a high profession of religion. </p>

                <p>Travelling through this settlement, I beheld<lb/> the pleasant situation of the
                    houses of the natives on<lb/> a rising ground, near a clear, running, stream,
                    sur-<lb/> rounded with trees which are evergreen;—my mind<lb/> was considerably
                    humbled on seeing the manner in<lb/> which they lived, and how free they were
                    from those<lb/> cares and wants, that luxury and pride have intro-<lb/>duced.
                    Their composure and serenity are remark-<lb/>able. After a long absence of an
                    Indian, they do not<lb/> show that ecstacy on his return, that we do in
                    meeting<lb/> a friend in such a case; but, when a suitable time<lb/> offers, he
                    says, <foreign xml:lang="iro">Satandoxry gawchee!</foreign> that is, <said

                </p>
                <p> About this time, I was informed of an interesting<lb/> circumstance, which
                    occurred among the <orgName key="wyandot">Wyandot</orgName>
                    <lb/> nation of Indians, with a deputation from Congress. <lb/> It appears that
                    in consequence of some encroachments<lb/> of the white people upon the borders
                    of their land, a<lb/> demur or dissatisfaction arose among the Indians, and<lb/>
                    the affair demanded the attention of <orgName key="congress">Congress</orgName>,
                    who<lb/> appointed a certain number of judicious men, of their<lb/> body, to
                    investigate the grievance. The Indians <lb/> being informed, a council was
                    called; and at a time<lb/> appointed, the deputies met them, and requested to be
                    <lb/> furnished with information of the boundaries of their<lb/> territory.
                    When, to their great surprise, a young<lb/> Indian stepped forth, and on behalf
                    of the council, in<lb/> a solemn manner, spoke thus: <said who="undetermined">He
                        who causes the <lb/>

                        eastern hills, and set<lb/> below the brow of the western mountains,—that

                        disrobed it again, in the fall.—it is He alone who hath <lb/> set bounds to
                        our country.</said> This speech so surprised<lb/> the auditory, though men
                    of great abilities, that they<lb/> knew not what reply or answer to make. </p>

                    <persName key="hsimm1">H. Simmons</persName>, jun. labours under the affliction
                    of the<lb/> ague. <persName key="jtuhi1">John Tuhi</persName> and <persName

                    in respect to sobriety and understanding, to many of<lb/> us, who are of a
                    fairer complexion. Their remarks<lb/> on divers matters were edifying. Speaking
                    of a<lb/> schoolmaster's qualifications, one of them observed<lb/> that the sort
                    of master they wanted, or required<lb/> amongst them was, not only one who was
                    qualified to<lb/> teach children, and keep the school in order, but one<lb/> who
                    would be an example to their parents. </p>
                <p> These men offered us their horses to ride to their<lb/>
                    <orgName key="brotherton">nation</orgName>, and they would go on foot, being
                    about<lb/> seventeen computed miles, through a country almost<lb/> impassible at
                    this season: but I could not accede to<lb/> their kind proposal. </p>
                <p> Had a meeting this morning. A number of Indians<lb/> came to see us,
                    notwithstanding it was very stormy.<lb/> I thought this a day of refreshment,
                    both in our little<lb/> sitting, and in some remarks made by the natives. </p>

                <p> A cold morning;—the wind north-east, and<lb/> the waters high in the creeks,
                    from the thaw of snow<lb/> that had occurred. We intended to set out for
                        <placeName key="stockbridge">Stock-<lb/> bridge</placeName> on foot, but as
                        <persName key="hsimm1">my companion</persName> was much re-<lb/> duced by
                    having the ague, together with some bag-<lb/> gage we had to take, it seemed a
                    little difficult. But <lb/>
                    <pb n="373" facs="SW_JC1797_Page_07"/> He who is a present help was near to
                    provide; for a<lb/>
                    <orgName key="stockbridge">Stockbridge</orgName> Indian came to the house at the
                    hour we<lb/> intended to depart, and agreed to carry our burdens.<lb/> From my
                    feelings, I had cause of thankfulness for<lb/> being here; believing the Lord is
                    bringing about a<lb/> great work in the earth.</p>
                <p> A man, called a <orgName key="bapt">Baptist</orgName> minister, was at
                        <placeName key="stockbridge">Stock-<lb/> bridge</placeName>. The Indians
                    snowed him our certificate; at<lb/> which he expressed his approbation, and
                    offered us<lb/> the use of his horse for a few days. </p>
                <p> Here we were informed that the <orgName key="oneida">Oneida</orgName>'s
                    conclu-<lb/> sion not to send their girls from their nation, had<lb/> such an
                    effect upon the <orgName key="tuscarora">Tuscaroras</orgName>, that
                    notwith-<lb/> standing we had delivered clothing for their children,<lb/> we had
                    to recommend them to deliver it to those who<lb/> offered voluntarily. We could
                    have had many more<lb/> of the <orgName key="stockbridge">Stockbridge</orgName>
                    children, than were specified in <lb/> our certificate; but to keep as near as
                    possible to<lb/> what was therein contained, was our earnest desire. </p>
                <p>
                    <persName key="hsimm1">My companion</persName> was so ill as we travelled
                    along,<lb/> that he entreated me to permit him to lie down on<lb/> the wet logs;
                    which I could not suffer; and whether<lb/> he would be able to reach the house
                    intended was un-<lb/> certain,—the road being so very miry. His illness<lb/> was
                    a considerable exercise to me, not only at this<lb/> time, but many others. At
                    length, we arrived at our<lb/> Indian brother's, where we were treated with
                    great<lb/> kindness, and much hospitality. </p>

                <p> A fine morning. My mind often felt the<lb/> sweet influences of Divine Goodness;
                    and I could be-<lb/> hold its salutary effects among some of these inhabi-<lb/>
                    tants of the wilderness. Their penetration and judg-<lb/> ment in religious
                    matters, are very evident and<lb/> striking, as may appear in the following
                    narrative. </p>

                <floatingText type="narrative">
                    <body>
                        <ab>It appears that two young men were prepared at<lb/>
                            <placeName>Princeton college</placeName>, to be sent as missionaries
                            among<lb/> the Indians. And in order to habituate themselves<lb/> to the
                            hardships that awaited them, they lodged upon<lb/> boards. When they set
                            out upon their mission, seve-<lb/> ral persons of respectability
                            accompanied them to<lb/> the <orgName key="creek">Creek
                            Nation</orgName>. When arrived, the Chiefs were<lb/> called,—a
                            conference was held with them, and it was<lb/> proposed to call a
                            Council; which being met, the<lb/> visitors informed them that they had
                            brought two<lb/> ministers of the gospel to preach salvation to
                            them;<lb/> and also a number of books, which would lead them<lb/> the
                            way to heaven. The Indians received the infor-<lb/> mation, without
                            apparent emotion; and said they<lb/> would consider the subject; which
                            should occupy the<lb/> space of fourteen days. Meanwhile the young
                            minis-<lb/> ters proposed preaching; but the Indians would not<lb/>
                            suffer them, until their own conclusions were made.<lb/> At the
                            expiration of the fourteen days, the Indians<lb/> made inquiry, whether
                            they had any dark-coloured<lb/> people among them, and whether they
                            preached the<lb/> gospel of salvation to them: whether they gave
                            them<lb/> those good books, which would show them the way to<lb/>
                            heaven; or, whether they treated them as slaves, or<lb/> as brothers.
                            Being answered accordingly, the In-<lb/> dians again spoke, <said
                                who="undetermined">Go home, and preach the gospel<lb/> of salvation
                                to them; give them those good books, that<lb/> will learn them the
                                way to heaven;—treat them as<lb/> brethren, and not as slaves; then
                                come and preach to<lb/> us.</said> In consequence of this refusal,
                            the whole mis-<lb/> sionary company returned; and one of them who
                            was<lb/> in the station of a congress-man, was so effected with<lb/> the
                            circumstance, that he emancipated all his slaves.</ab>

                <p>When I came home, I called upon the person, and <lb/>
                    <pb n="375" facs="SW_JC1797_Page_09"/> inquired more fully respecting the
                    matter, when he<lb/> readily, seriously, and fully confirmed the same. </p>
                <p> I never experienced greater kindness than from the<lb/> Indians. I had not only
                    their horses to ride, but a<lb/> guide from place to place, The natives would
                    not<lb/> permit me even to carry my portmanteau, nor scarce-<lb/> ly to go over
                    a bridge that was dangerous, but offered<lb/> to carry me over in their arms;
                    though I would not<lb/> suffer them. When I lodged with the Indians, they<lb/>
                    would build a large fire at bed-time, in the room that<lb/> I occupied, and
                    always renewed it at midnight;—the<lb/> family being remarkably still, whether
                    up or a-bed. </p>

                        >Bro-<lb/>thertown</placeName>, having the Chief's horse to ride, with
                    one<lb/> of their principal men for a guide. We travelled<lb/> through a most

                    and sometimes<lb/> two, in an hour. Arrived at <placeName key="broth"
                        >Brothertown</placeName> in the<lb/> evening, and were treated with all the

                    being still accommodated with horses and a guide.<lb/> The roads were beyond

                <p> This morning our Indian girls came, each<lb/> one accompanied by her parent or
                    guardian. The<lb/> business of parting was conducted with great serious-<lb/>
                    ness, for the Indians delivered their children to us<lb/> with the utmost
                    confidence and quietude: which<lb/> brought over my mind a considerable weight
                    of con-<lb/> cern and care, that nothing on my part, might ob-<lb/> struct this
                    great and important work. The girls ma-<lb/>
                    <pb n="376" facs="SW_JC1797_Page_10"/> nifested much stillness and composure, at
                    taking<lb/> leave of their parents, to go a long journey, with<lb/> perfect
                    strangers, to reside in a distant land. So we<lb/> went to the <geogName
                        key="mohaw">Mohawk river</geogName>, and they stepped into<lb/> the boat,
                    wrapped their faces in their blankets, and<lb/> I do not remember that they
                    uttered a word. We<lb/> now had to pass down this river about one hundred<lb/>
                    miles, but got on very well the first day's voyage. </p>

                <p> A rainy morning, though mild. Our girls<lb/> conduct themselves with so much
                    propriety, that<lb/> they are remarked by persons of respectability. My<lb/>
                    mind was frequently exercised, so as not to suffer<lb/> me to sleep; hoping
                    nothing might befall my tender<lb/> children, that would obstruct this good
                    work, which<lb/> the Lord is about to carry on from sea to sea, and to<lb/> the
                    uttermost parts of the earth. </p>
                <p> We left <placeName key="alban">Albany</placeName> about four o'clock in the
                    after-<lb/> noon, and came to <placeName key="huds">Hudson</placeName> that
                    night, about thirty<lb/> miles; notwithstanding we were aground, and laid<lb/>
                    at anchor till the tide floated us off. Next day we<lb/> had a head wind; but
                    our family appeared cheerful,<lb/> which is a considerable satisfaction, and
                    cause of<lb/> thankfulness unto Him who is a present helper in<lb/> every
                    needful time. </p>

                <p> A clear, cold morning. Run aground by<lb/> means of a strong wind from the
                    western shore, about <lb/>
                    <pb n="378" facs="SW_JC1797_Page_12"/> nine miles above New York. When the tide
                    was in<lb/> favour, we carried out our anchor, but all endeavours<lb/> at this
                    time, proved in vain; and we were obliged to<lb/> remain in the cold, until the
                    tide should rise again.<lb/> In the evening, we renewed our efforts, and
                    were<lb/> favoured to effect our design. We arrived opposite<lb/> New York about
                    nine o'clock in the evening, but<lb/> the tide run so strong that the captain
                    said he could<lb/> not bring the vessel to shore. Being desirous of mo-<lb/>
                    ving forward as fast as practicable, we engaged the<lb/> boat to take us ashore;
                    which being covered with ice<lb/> on every part, and tossing so much, that it
                    was with<lb/> difficulty we could get in. At length we arrived<lb/> safely in
                    New York, and were kindly received by<lb/> our friend <persName key="epryo1"
                        >Edmund Pryor</persName>; and may truly say, from<lb/> the tenderness that
                    was shown to us, and to the In-<lb/> dian girls, it was " like a brook by the
                    way." </p>

                <p> A snowy morning. Friends manifested<lb/> much kindness towards us, particularly
                        <persName key="jdela1">Joseph De-<lb/>laplaine</persName>, who accompanied
                    us to the vessel, and pre-<lb/>sented to each of the girls a piece of silver. We
                    ar-<lb/> rived safely at <placeName key="bruns">Brunswick</placeName> about
                    seven o'clock in<lb/> the evening. There was here, at this time, a certain<lb/>
                    great man from Poland, who had never seen an In-<lb/> dian, and was desirous of
                    being introduced to the<lb/> girls. They being in a private room at supper,
                    he<lb/> walked in to take a view of them. When he beheld<lb/> their orderly
                    deportment, he seemed much surpri-<lb/> sed; and after walking round the table
                    where they<lb/> were sitting, he said, <said who="#kosci">These are almost
                        civilized<lb/> already.</said> I informed him that the father of one of<lb/>
                    them would not drink wine. </p>
                <p> The same evening, the Poland general and his<lb/> company came into the room,
                    where <persName key="hsimm1">my companion</persName>
                    <lb/>
                    <pb n="379" facs="SW_JC1797_Page_13"/> and I were sitting. In the course of the
                    conversa-<lb/> tion, the word thou was used, which attracted the<lb/> attention
                    of a young man, who remarked in French<lb/> to the general, that we, as a
                    people, had a very un-<lb/> couth way of speaking thou; — he apprehended, as
                    I<lb/> suppose, that we should not understand what he<lb/> said in that
                    language. However, I informed him,<lb/> that it was the language of the Almighty
                    to the first<lb/> man, Adam; therefore bid him not reflect upon the<lb/> people
                    for using the language, which the Lord had<lb/> taught them. He looked confused;
                    and the Polander,<lb/> who understood English, appeared to favour the ob-<lb/>
                    servation. </p>

                <p> Set out before day, and reached <placeName>Princeton</placeName><lb/> by
                    breakfast-time. Through the continuance of Di-<lb/> vine favour, my family
                    continue well, except <persName key="hsimm1">He-<lb/>nry</persName>, whose ague
                    remains with him. Passing on, we<lb/> arrived safely at <placeName key="brist"
                        >Bristol</placeName> in Pennsylvania, where we<lb/> parted. <persName
                        key="hsimm1">Henry</persName> took charge of the children, and<lb/> went to
                    his home in that neighbourhood, where it<lb/> was concluded the girls should
                    remain until I should<lb/> return from <placeName key="phila"
                        >Philadelphia</placeName>. Accordingly I took pas-<lb/> sage in the stage,
                    and reached home about nine<lb/> o'clock in the evening; where, through the
                    favour<lb/> of a kind, preserving Providence, I found my fami-<lb/>ly well, and
                    we were mutually rejoiced to see each<lb/> other. </p>

                <p> A few Friends were called together, in or-<lb/> der to be informed of my
                    proceedings, and to con-<lb/> sider what necessary step should be taken
                    next.--<lb/> They expressed their satisfaction with my commu-<lb/> nication, and
                    concluded that I should return the next <lb/> day to <persName key="hsimm1"
                        >Henry Simmons</persName>'s, and bring the girls down<lb/> to <placeName

                <p> Rode to <placeName key="brist">Bristol</placeName>, and next morning to
                    Hen-<lb/>ry <persName key="hsimm1">Simmons</persName>'s, where the girls,
                    remained during my<lb/> absence. </p>
                <pb n="380" facs="SW_JC1797_Page_14"/>
                <p> Being equipped, we again set out, and ar-<lb/>rived at my house about sun-set.
                    The girls continu-<lb/>ed with us for three days; during which time, they<lb/>
                    conducted themselves in an orderly manner; and<lb/> occasionally read the
                    Scriptures. Many Friends call-<lb/>ed to see them, and gave them a number of
                    small<lb/> presents. </p>
                <p> The next concern was, to find suitable places for<lb/> them. We accordingly set
                    out for <persName key="jemle1">James Emlen</persName>'s,<lb/> in Delaware
                    county, where we arrived safely, and<lb/> were kindly treated. </p>

                <p> we had them all taken to<lb/> meeting, where they behaved in a becoming
                    man-<lb/>ner. In the course of a few days, we had them sta-<lb/>tioned at the
                    Friends' houses, who were willing to<lb/> take charge of them, and instruct them
                    in the busi-<lb/>ness of housewifery. Two of the girls were placed<lb/> with
                        <persName key="ncoop1">Nathan Coope</persName> and son;—one, with a
                    woman<lb/> Friend, who had a concern to take charge of one of<lb/> the
                    Indians;—one was placed with the family of<lb/>
                    <persName key="wjack1">William Jackson</persName>, and the remaining two with
                        <persName key="ijack1">Isaac<lb/> Jackson</persName>. At my taking leave of
                    them, they wept<lb/> considerably; and I felt much tenderness toward<lb/> them,
                    when I reflected upon the confidence which<lb/> their parents had placed in me.
                    On looking over<lb/> this journey, I may thankfully acknowledge, that<lb/>
                    through adorable mercy, I have witnessed preserva-<lb/>tion; and may the great
                    Preserver of men have the<lb/> praise </p>
